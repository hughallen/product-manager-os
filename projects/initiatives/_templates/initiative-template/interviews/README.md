# User Interviews

## Purpose
This folder contains all user research artifacts including interview transcripts, snapshots, and synthesis.

## Structure

### `transcripts/`
Raw interview recordings, notes, or transcripts from user conversations.

**Naming:** `transcript-[participant-name]-[date].md`

### `snapshots/`
Structured interview snapshots created using `@pm-toolkit/2-discovery/continuous-discovery-habits/create-interview-snapshots.mdc`

**Naming:** `snapshot-[participant-name]-[date].md`

Each snapshot extracts:
- Key stories and behaviors
- User journey maps
- Opportunities identified
- Insights and patterns

### `synthesis/`
Cross-interview analysis created using `@pm-toolkit/2-discovery/continuous-discovery-habits/synthesize-interview-snapshots.mdc`

**Naming:** `synthesis-[date].md` or `synthesis-[theme].md`

Synthesis documents identify:
- Patterns across interviews
- Common themes and pain points
- Prioritized opportunities
- Recommendations for product direction

## Workflow

1. **Conduct interviews** → Save notes/transcripts to `transcripts/`
2. **Create snapshots** → Use `@pm-toolkit/2-discovery/continuous-discovery-habits/create-interview-snapshots.mdc`
3. **Synthesize findings** → Use `@pm-toolkit/2-discovery/continuous-discovery-habits/synthesize-interview-snapshots.mdc`
4. **Identify opportunities** → Use `@pm-toolkit/2-discovery/continuous-discovery-habits/create-opportunities.mdc`
