# Solutions - Discovery Track

**Purpose:** Solution ideas for identified opportunities (before committing to build)

---

## Solution Generation Approach

Per Continuous Discovery Habits framework:
1. Generate multiple solutions per opportunity (diverge)
2. Evaluate trade-offs (effort, impact, risk)
3. Test assumptions before building (converge)
4. Move validated solutions to Delivery Track (specs/)

---

## Current State

**Status:** Need data to determine which opportunities to solve for

**Blocker:** Don't know which persona has activation problem yet

**For Case Study:**
- Present multiple solution scenarios based on persona diagnosis
- Show hypothesis-driven approach
- Demonstrate assumption testing methodology

## Solution Ideas (Pending Data Validation)

### IF Persona 1 (Beginner) is the Problem:

**Opportunity:** Trust & Legitimacy Gap  
**Solutions:**
1. Buyer protection badge prominently displayed
2. First-order guarantee/money-back
3. Real customer success stories on homepage
4. Video tour explaining how Fleek works

**Opportunity:** Financial Risk  
**Solutions:**
1. Surface 10-20 piece bundles (£50-200) in beginner flow
2. "Start small" guided experience
3. Budget-based personalization
4. First-order discount

**Opportunity:** Product Uncertainty  
**Solutions:**
1. Bundle preview with size/brand breakdown
2. Representative photos (Fleek Sort enables this)
3. "What you'll get" transparency module
4. Example bundle unpacking videos

---

### IF Persona 3 (Wholesale) is the Problem:

**Opportunity:** Poor Desktop Experience  
**Solutions:**
1. Desktop-optimized browse/cart experience
2. Bulk actions (add multiple bundles faster)
3. Comparison tools for large orders
4. Desktop-first design patterns

---

## Assumption Testing

Before building solutions, test:
1. **Desirability:** Do users want this? (user testing, feedback)
2. **Viability:** Can business support this? (unit economics, ops)
3. **Feasibility:** Can we build this? (technical constraints, timeline)
4. **Usability:** Will users understand/use this? (prototype testing)

---

## Next Steps

1. Run data analysis to determine which persona
2. Use `@pm-toolkit/2-discovery/continuous-discovery-habits/generate-solutions.mdc`
3. Test assumptions before moving to specs/
4. Prioritize solutions by impact × feasibility
