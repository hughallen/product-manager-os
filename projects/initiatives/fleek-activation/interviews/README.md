## Current State

**User Feedback Available:**
See `projects/product-artifacts/feedback/feedback-snippets.md` for qualitative user quotes organized by theme:
1. Trust & Legitimacy Anxiety
2. Confusion Over Rating System
3. Product Uncertainty
4. Financial Risk for Small Buyers
5. Friction in Search and UI

**Attribution Unknown:**
- We have user quotes but don't know which personas they came from
- Need to segment feedback by persona (Beginner vs Scale vs Wholesale)
- Would normally conduct follow-up interviews to validate

**For Case Study:**
Since we can't conduct actual interviews, we're using:
- Existing user feedback quotes
- Hannah & Sanket interview insights
- Fleek website research
- Competitor UX analysis

## Next Steps

1. **If had access:** Conduct 5-8 user interviews segmented by persona
2. **For case study:** Use existing qualitative data + propose interview plan
3. **Post-data analysis:** Validate which persona quotes belong to
