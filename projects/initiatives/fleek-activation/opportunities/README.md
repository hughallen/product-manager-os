## 10 Activation Opportunities (From Evidence)

### 1. Platform Looks Like Scam at First Impression
**Evidence:**
> "It seemed like such a scam to me like just the way it like presented itself… it just screams like red flag to me."

> "It kind of sounded too good to be true… I didn't want to get catfished."

**User Need:** Visual credibility and legitimacy signals upfront

**Opportunity:** Improve design quality, professional branding, remove "scam" triggers

---

### 2. Negative Reviews Visible Without Context
**Evidence:**
> "I was a bit sketchy at first because I did look at reviews and stuff and the reviews weren't always very positive… I heard a lot of people that they got wrong orders… and they got dirty clothes or fake clothes."

**From UX audit:** Bad reviews surfaced prominently at top of supplier listings

**User Need:** Understand negative reviews in context (delivery issues vs product issues)

**Opportunity:** Rating transparency, review categorization, supplier response visibility

---

### 3. Quality Control Not Visible
**Evidence:**
> "It's quite scary just knowing that there's so many fakes about and they won't be picked up. …The main selling point for me when I started buying on Fleek was that everything would be authentic and it come out at quality control… but then if it's not going to then that element of trust is definitely removed."

**User Need:** See proof that QC happens before risking money

**Opportunity:** Make QC process visible, buyer protection prominent, authenticity guarantees clear

---

### 4. Rating System Components Unclear
**Evidence:**
> "I can never really figure out exactly what's caused that score to be low. …Was it delivery time? Don't know."

> "So see this rating here product quality and supplier service. Is that like two different ratable? …I can't really tell what has gone into that, what constitutes their rating."

**User Need:** Understand what drives ratings to evaluate suppliers accurately

**Opportunity:** Break down ratings (delivery, quality, service), explain scoring algorithm

---

### 5. Example Photos Are Misleading
**Evidence:**
> "I weren't sure 100%… is the listing I've selected is that just generic and I won't receive the actual items in the photograph. …I saw the same picture on multiple listings."

**User Need:** Know if photos show actual bundle contents or just examples

**Opportunity:** Clear labeling (Example vs Actual), representative photos, Fleek Sort enables this

---

### 6. Bundle Contents Unclear (Size/Material/Brand)
**Evidence:**
> "I've got no idea specifically how many units are going to be small, how many going to be medium, what material they're going to be."

> "They adverted as vintage jeans and then they put a bunch of brands behind them… and then you get four jeans that are unbranded."

**User Need:** Know size breakdown, material types, brand composition before buying

**Opportunity:** Bundle preview with size/brand/material breakdowns

---

### 7. Bundles Too Expensive for Testing
**Evidence:**
> "A lot of the higher priced things are out of my price range because they're such big bundles... I think a lot of the more expensive things you're looking 4, 500 and it's not something I can do at the minute."

> "I don't start with an order of 500 that's just too risky. …When I find a new supplier I would like to try I do a small order of €50 so I can see how does it arrive."

**User Need:** Test with small orders (10-20 pieces, £50-200) before committing

**Opportunity:** Surface small MOQ bundles prominently, budget-based filtering

---

### 8. Browse-First Users Can't Discover
**Evidence:**
> "I don't go on the app knowing what I'm looking for. So when I go on there, I don't know what I'm searching for… so the search to me there's nothing for me to put in. so I don't think I've ever used it to be honest."

**User Need:** Discover products when don't know specific search terms

**Opportunity:** Category-based browse, guided discovery, curated collections

---

### 9. Desktop Experience Poor
**Evidence:**
> "I think on desktop it's not the best. I think it definitely needs improved."

**From Hannah:** "Big spenders (£3-5k transactions) prefer laptop browsing"

**User Need:** Desktop-optimized experience for large purchases

**Opportunity:** Desktop-first design for wholesale/large buyers

---

### 10. Cart Performance Issues
**Evidence:**
> "The basket takes like really long time to like updates. So once I'm like trying to like actually check out and then I'll need to remove some of the stuff… It just gives me like a lot of time in spinning spinning spinning."

**User Need:** Fast, responsive cart experience

**Opportunity:** Optimize cart performance, remove friction at conversion point

## Additional UX Audit Findings

**From UX analysis (not directly user-quoted):**
- No personalization feedback loop (questions asked but no results shown)
- Design inconsistency (blurry graphics, poor branding)
- Phone number required too early (before value shown)
- Pricing model confusion (bundles + sliding scale)

---

## ❓ Critical Unknown

**Which opportunities matter most?**
- Need data to determine which persona(s) have activation problem
- Opportunities may apply differently to Beginner vs Scale vs Wholesale
- Can't prioritize without understanding where users drop off

**Next:** Data analysis to validate which opportunities correlate with activation failure

## For Case Study

These 10 opportunities represent the solution space. After data analysis determines which persona(s) and where they drop off, we can prioritize by:
- **Impact:** Which opportunities address the biggest drop-off points?
- **Feasibility:** Which can be solved in 6 weeks with 2 engineers?
- **Evidence:** Which have strongest user signal?
