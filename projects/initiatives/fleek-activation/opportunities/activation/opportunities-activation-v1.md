| 1 | I want to trust the platform but blurry, low-quality graphics make it look like a scam, making it difficult to commit | **CRITICAL** - UX audit + 3 user quotes | "Seemed like such a scam", "too good to be true", "sketchy at first" + UX: "Blurry graphics throughout" |
| 2 | I want to choose reliable suppliers but can't figure out what drives their ratings, making it difficult to evaluate risk | 4 user quotes + UX audit | "Can never figure out what's caused that score to be low... was it delivery time?" **Solution hint:** Secondary ratings should use chips (badges) instead of numbers to reduce confusion |
| 3 | I want to buy authentic items but can't see quality control process, making it difficult to trust product quality | 1 user quote + UX audit | "Main selling point was QC... but if it's not going to then trust is removed" + UX: "QC hidden" |
| 4 | I want to feel confident about suppliers but bad reviews are shown first, making it difficult to trust | UX audit - **CRITICAL** | "Bad reviews at top of page" - reinforces skepticism when already doubtful |
| 5 | I want to feel protected but buyer protection is hidden in settings, making it difficult to feel safe | UX audit - **CRITICAL** | "Buyer protection hidden in settings... should be visible early in journey" |
| 6 | I want consistent experience but emails are poor quality and off-brand, making it difficult to maintain trust | UX audit - High | "Onboarding email confusing", "Promo emails poor quality and inconsistent" |

### Parent C: Personalization Failure

| ID | Opportunity Statement | Evidence | Source |
|----|----------------------|----------|--------|
| 12 | I want to see personalized results but get no feedback after answering questions, making it difficult to see value of effort | UX audit - **CRITICAL** | "No feedback loop after personalization... breaks trust in technology" |

## Assessment (Parent-Level Comparison)

### Parent A: Trust & Legitimacy Barriers (Opps 1-6)

**Opportunities:**
- Opp 1: Blurry graphics make platform look like scam
- Opp 2: Can't figure out supplier ratings  
- Opp 3: Quality control invisible
- Opp 4: Bad reviews shown first
- Opp 5: Buyer protection hidden
- Opp 6: Email quality inconsistent

**Factors Considered:**

**Opportunity Sizing:**
- 4 of 5 user feedback themes relate to trust (most frequent concern)
- Affects users at EVERY touchpoint: signup, supplier pages, emails
- Universal barrier (all personas affected)
- UX audit marks 3 as **CRITICAL**

**Market Factors:**
- Table stakes for marketplace trust (Vinted, Depop solved this)
- Competitors show buyer protection prominently
- Trust is prerequisite for B2B transactions

**Company Factors:**
- **Strategic Alignment:** Activation is Hannah's stated priority
- **Resource Considerations:** Opps 1, 5, 6 are quick wins (design/visibility)
- **Existing Assets:** Buyer protection exists but hidden, QC exists but not communicated
- **Quick Wins:** Opp 1 (graphics), Opp 5 (move buyer protection), Opp 6 (email templates)

**Customer Factors:**
- High importance (quoted 7 times across trust themes)
- Very low satisfaction (users need human validation: "spoke to someone physically")
- Existing alternatives: Established marketplaces have trust solved

**Discussion:**
Trust is foundational - users won't engage if platform looks like scam. **Multiple quick wins available** that could compound: fix graphics + surface buyer protection + improve review sorting = measurable trust lift.

**Tentative Winners (3 Quick Wins):** 
- Opp 1 (Blurry graphics) - Most universal, design refresh
- Opp 5 (Buyer protection hidden) - Move to prominent location
- Opp 4 (Bad reviews first) - Adjust algorithm

---

### Parent B: Onboarding Friction (Opps 7-11)

**Opportunities:**
- Opp 7: Don't know why answering questions
- Opp 8: Phone number required too early
- Opp 9: No mission statement
- Opp 10: Can't swipe through onboarding
- Opp 11: "Maybe later" too easy to skip

**Factors Considered:**

**Opportunity Sizing:**
- Affects 100% of new users (onboarding funnel)
- UX audit marks Opp 7 as **CRITICAL**
- May cause drop-off before value is seen

**Market Factors:**
- Competitors (Grailed, Depop) make personalization value explicit
- Standard patterns: swipe-through, skip in corner, clear value prop
- Table stakes for mobile onboarding

**Company Factors:**
- **Strategic Alignment:** Onboarding launched (Dec 2025) but "slight lift" - needs improvement
- **Resource Considerations:** Opps 7, 9, 11 are copy/UX changes (low effort)
- **Current State:** Hannah noted personalization "works but users don't see it"

**Customer Factors:**
- High importance (onboarding sets first impression)
- Low satisfaction (no feedback loop, unclear value)
- ❓ Unknown: Do users who complete onboarding convert more?

**Discussion:**
Onboarding is the first value delivery moment. If users don't understand why they're answering questions (Opp 7) or can easily skip (Opp 11), personalization fails before it starts. Combined with Parent C (no feedback), this is a compound problem.

**Tentative Winner:** Opp 7 (Explain "why") - Prerequisite for all other onboarding improvements

---

### Parent C: Personalization Failure (Opps 12-13)

**Opportunities:**
- Opp 12: No feedback after personalization
- Opp 13: Homepage generic despite personalization

**Factors Considered:**

**Opportunity Sizing:**
- Affects users who completed onboarding (invested effort)
- UX audit calls this **"the biggest onboarding failure"**
- Both marked **CRITICAL**

**Market Factors:**
- Grailed, Depop, Etsy: Immediate visual confirmation personalization worked
- Competitors show: "Based on your preferences" or "Picked for you"
- This is differentiator - if it works

**Company Factors:**
- **Strategic Alignment:** Personalization is core feature, launched Dec 2025
- **Hannah Quote:** "slight lift" suggests it's not delivering value
- **Resource Considerations:** May require feed algorithm work (medium effort)
- **Critical Unknown:** Does personalization actually work backend? Or just not visible?

**Customer Factors:**
- Very high importance (user invested time, expects reward)
- Very low satisfaction (UX audit: "breaks trust in technology")
- Creates distrust cascade: "Why did I answer questions if nothing changed?"

**Discussion:**
This compounds with Parent B. If users answer questions (Opp 7) but see no results (Opps 12-13), they feel deceived. **Critical to understand: Does personalization work technically but just isn't visible? Or doesn't work at all?**

**Tentative Winner:** Both (interconnected) - Must show feedback loop AND personalized results

---

### Parent D: Product Uncertainty (Opps 14-17)

**Opportunities:**
- Opp 14: Don't know if photos show actual items
- Opp 15: Don't know bundle composition
- Opp 16: Quality expectations not set upfront
- Opp 17: Don't know supplier specialization

**Factors Considered:**

**Opportunity Sizing:**
- 4+ quotes across 4 users
- Affects purchase decision moment (high-intent users)
- UX audit marks Opp 16 as High priority

**Market Factors:**
- Competitors (Etsy, eBay) show clear product/seller details
- Fleek Sort (end March) enables better photos (Opp 14)
- Differentiation opportunity (transparent bundle contents)

**Company Factors:**
- **Strategic Alignment:** "Transparency" is website value prop
- **Timing:** Fleek Sort rollout (end March) enables Opp 14 solution
- **Resources:** 
  - Opp 15: Requires supplier data collection (medium effort)
  - Opp 16: UX copy/expectation setting (low effort)
  - Opp 17: Supplier profile enhancement (medium effort)

**Customer Factors:**
- High importance for first purchase (risk mitigation)
- Satisfaction very low: "surprised when I got kids stuff", "disappointed by quality"
- Alternatives: None at wholesale level (opportunity for differentiation)

**Discussion:**
Bundle transparency is table stakes but not implemented. **Opp 16 (set expectations)** is quickest win - "This is grade B quality, expect some wear" prevents disappointment. Opps 15, 17 require supplier data.

**Tentative Winners (by timeline):** 
- **Now:** Opp 16 (Set quality expectations) - Quick copy fix
- **Post-Fleek Sort:** Opp 14 (Photo clarity) - Enabled by March rollout

---

### Parent F: Pricing Confusion (Opps 21-22)

**Opportunities:**
- Opp 21: Bundles + sliding scale creates complexity
- Opp 22: Can't afford to test with large bundles

**Factors Considered:**

**Opportunity Sizing:**
- Opp 21: UX audit - Medium (affects understanding)
- Opp 22: 2 user quotes
- May be persona-specific (beginners vs wholesale)
- ❓ Unknown: What % of users are in £50-200 budget range?

**Market Factors:**
- Fleek website says "small MOQs (10-20 pieces)" exist
- Competitors (Vinted, Depop) have clear per-item pricing
- Question: Are small bundles discoverable, or only large bundles shown?

**Company Factors:**
- **Strategic Alignment:** Website targets beginners with "small MOQs to reduce risk"
- **Resources:** 
  - Opp 21: UX copy clarification (low effort)
  - Opp 22: Product audit first (do small bundles exist?) then discoverability
- **Business Model:** Need data on small bundle profitability

**Customer Factors:**
- Opp 21: Medium importance (confusion, not blocker)
- Opp 22: High importance for budget-constrained users
- May be activation blocker if £400-500 bundles shown to £200 budget users
- ❓ Unknown: Is Opp 22 testing need or hard budget constraint?

**Discussion:**
**Opp 21 (Pricing complexity):** Two models (bundles + sliding scale) create confusion about final price. Low effort to clarify.

**Opp 22 (Bundle affordability):** Critical unknown - Do small bundles exist but aren't discoverable? Or don't exist? This changes solution dramatically (search/filtering vs supplier incentives).

**Next Step:** Product audit before solution generation for Opp 22

---

### Parent E: Discovery Overload (Opps 18-20)

**Opportunities:**
- Opp 18: Too much going on (cognitive overload)
- Opp 19: Can't discover without search terms
- Opp 20: Desktop experience poor for large buyers

**Factors Considered:**

**Opportunity Sizing:**
- Opp 18: UX audit - High (affects homepage experience)
- Opp 19: 1 user quote (browse-first behavior)
- Opp 20: 1 user + Hannah validation ("big spenders prefer laptop")
- May be persona-specific (beginners browse, wholesale searches)

**Market Factors:**
- Browse-first: Vinted, Depop excel at discovery with curation
- Desktop: Etsy, eBay have strong desktop experiences
- Cognitive overload: Anti-pattern, competitors simplify

**Company Factors:**
- **Hannah's Priority:** "Web platform underinvestment... strongly believe we've under invested"
- **Resources:** 
  - Opp 18: Medium effort (homepage redesign)
  - Opp 19: Medium effort (browse UI)
  - Opp 20: Large effort (desktop overhaul)
- **Current State:** Platform "pushes to app"

**Customer Factors:**
- Opp 18: High importance (homepage = first browsing experience)
- Opp 19: Important for browse-first users (don't know what they want)
- Opp 20: Critical for "£3-5k transactions" (Hannah) - wholesale buyers
- Satisfaction: Low for all

**Discussion:**
Opp 18 compounds with Parent C (personalization failure) - generic homepage + cognitive overload = paralysis. **These may be persona-specific.** Need data on browse vs search behavior.

**Tentative Winner:** Opp 18 (Simplify homepage) if data shows drop-off at browsing stage

---

### Parent G: Conversion Friction (Opp 23)

**Opportunity:**
- Opp 23: Cart performance blocks checkout

**Factors Considered:**

**Opportunity Sizing:**
- 1 user quote (cart spinning)
- High-intent users affected (already added to cart = purchase intent)
- May be most critical drop-off point (highest cost to business)

**Market Factors:**
- Cart performance: Table stakes for e-commerce
- Any friction at checkout = lost revenue
- Competitors have fast, responsive carts

**Company Factors:**
- **Resources:** Performance optimization (technical debt, medium-high effort)
- **Strategic Alignment:** Conversion optimization is activation priority
- **Business Impact:** Directly affects revenue (vs earlier stage issues)

**Customer Factors:**
- **Critical importance:** Blocks actual purchase completion
- Very low satisfaction: "spinning spinning spinning... really long time"
- At highest-intent moment (in cart, ready to buy)

**Discussion:**
This is the **most expensive drop-off point** - user has overcome all trust barriers, found product, added to cart, but can't checkout. Technical debt fix, but high ROI if cart abandonment is significant.

**Tentative Winner:** Opp 23 if data shows cart abandonment is high

---

## ❓ Critical Unknowns

Before prioritizing, need data on:
1. **Which persona has activation problem?** (Changes opportunity prioritization)
2. **Where do users drop off?** (Signup → Onboarding → Browse → Product page → Cart → Checkout?)
3. **Does personalization work technically?** (Opps 12-13 - backend vs frontend issue?)
4. **Do small bundles exist?** (Opp 22 - product audit needed)
5. **Browse vs search behavior by persona?** (Opps 18-19 relevance)
6. **Desktop vs mobile conversion rates?** (Opp 20 impact)
7. **Cart abandonment rate?** (Opp 23 urgency)

---

---

## Prioritization Framework (Once Data Available)

**1. Where do users drop off?** → Narrows to relevant parent category

**2. Quick wins first:** Low effort, high impact (Opps 1, 4, 5, 7, 11, 16)

**3. Persona-specific:** If one persona has problem, prioritize their opportunities

**4. Compounding effects:** Bundle opportunities that reinforce each other (e.g., Trust Bundle)

---

## Recommendation: Evidence-Based Prioritization

### For Case Study (6-Week Timeline)

**Week 1-2: "Trust & Polish" Sprint (All 🔴 Strong Evidence + Low Effort)**
1. Opp 1: Fix blurry graphics (🔴 Rank 1)
2. Opp 4: Adjust review algorithm (🔴 Rank 6) 
3. Opp 5: Surface buyer protection (🔴 Rank 7)
4. Opp 7: Add "why we're asking" copy (🟡 Rank 8)
5. Opp 16: Set quality expectations (🟡 Rank 11)

**Rationale:** 5 quick wins, 4 with strong evidence, all compound to build trust

**Week 3-4: "Personalization Fix" Sprint (🔴 Strong Evidence + Medium Effort)**
1. Opp 12-13: Personalization feedback loop + homepage (🔴 Rank 3-4)
   - First: Validate if personalization works backend
   - Then: Show it works (feedback loop + visual confirmation)

**Rationale:** UX audit calls this "biggest onboarding failure" - CRITICAL priority

**Week 5-6: "Product Transparency" Sprint (Mixed Evidence)**
1. Opp 15: Bundle composition (🔴 Rank 5 - 3 user quotes)
2. Opp 2: Rating breakdown (🔴 Rank 2 - 4 user quotes) - if time permits

**Rationale:** High purchase impact, requires supplier data collection
