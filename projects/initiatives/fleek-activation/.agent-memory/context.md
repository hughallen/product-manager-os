# Current Context - Fleek Activation Initiative

**Last Updated:** February 16, 2026  
**Status:** Planning / Interview Prep (with major corrections in progress)

---

## Current State

### What We're Working On
Case study preparation for PM interview at Fleek, focusing on activation problem for new users.

### Phase
**Discovery → Planning → Interview Prep**
- ✅ Gathered context (company overview, meeting notes, user feedback)
- ✅ Created personas (corrected with evidence rigor)
- ⚠️ Created planning docs (need revision - built on faulty assumptions)
- 🔄 **Current:** Fixing methodology errors and file organization
- ⏭️ **Next:** Data analysis → Solution design for interview

### What Changed Recently
Major course correction after realizing violations of AGENTS.md principles:
1. Removed fabricated Hannah quote about "overwhelming" beginners
2. Marked unknowns explicitly - don't know which persona has activation problem
3. Restructured personas.md with evidence rigor (✅ ⚠️ ❓ markers)
4. Creating .agent-memory/ files per AGENTS.md requirements

## Available Context

### ✅ What We Know (Validated)

**From Leadership (Hannah & Sanket):**
- Strong acquisition but weak activation/retention
- "Retention rates kind of plateauing, dropping a little bit over time" (Hannah)
- "First time users" need faster path to aha moment (Hannah)
- "That first time experience and the first time purchase" needs work (Hannah)
- Platform serves "bulk menswear buying journeys" well (Hannah)
- Women's wear buyers "very curated... aesthetic and style driven" (Hannah)
- Women's wear is 70% of market but only 20-30% of Fleek revenue (Hannah)
- Big spenders (£3-5k) prefer desktop (Hannah)
- Onboarding launched with "slight lift but nothing meaningful"

**From Fleek Website:**
- 3 customer segments: Beginner Resellers, Scale Resellers, Wholesale Retailers
- Each segment has distinct value props and features
- 300,000+ resellers and retailers
- 1,000+ verified suppliers

**From User Feedback (5 themes with direct quotes):**
1. Trust & Legitimacy - "seemed like a scam", "too good to be true"
2. Rating Confusion - "can never really figure out what's caused that score to be low"
3. Product Uncertainty - "weren't sure 100%", "got no idea specifically how many units"
4. Financial Risk - "£400-500 out of my price range", "start with €50 small order"
5. Search/UI Friction - "don't go on the app knowing what I'm looking for"

### ❓ Critical Unknowns (Need Data)

**Persona Diagnosis:**
- What % of signups are Beginner vs Scale vs Wholesale?
- Which persona(s) have the activation problem?
- What is activation rate by persona?
- Where do they drop off in funnel?

**User Feedback Attribution:**
- Which persona(s) gave the user feedback quotes?
- Are budget concerns (£50-200) from Beginners, or from all personas?
- Do all personas experience trust issues, or just Beginners?

**Product:**
- Are small MOQ bundles (10-20 pieces, £50-200) actually visible on platform?
- What's the actual bundle price distribution?
- Do users find beginner-friendly bundles or only see expensive ones?

### ⚠️ Assumed (Need Validation)

**Behavioral:**
- Beginners are browse-first (suggested by 1 user quote)
- Scale resellers are search-first (logical but not validated)
- Beginners are mobile-first (not validated)
- Budget constraints are primary blocker (suggested but not quantified)

**Solutions:**
- Trust signals will improve conversion (logical but not tested)
- Rating transparency matters (suggested by feedback but not measured)
- Small bundles surfaced will drive activation (logical but not validated)

## Current Gaps

### Process Gaps
- ❌ Missing dual-track folder structure (interviews/, opportunities/, solutions/, etc.)
- ❌ Planning docs assume Persona 1 is problem (need to reframe as conditional)
- ❌ No data analysis done yet (need before interview)

### Knowledge Gaps
- ❓ Which persona has activation problem
- ❓ Actual funnel drop-off points
- ❓ Current activation rate baseline
- ❓ Bundle price distribution
- ❓ MOQ visibility on platform

### File Organization Gaps
- 🔄 Personas both company-wide AND initiative-specific (unclear which is correct per AGENTS.md)
- 🔄 Competitors analysis at project level vs initiative level
- 🔄 Missing interviews/, opportunities/, solutions/ folders in initiative

## Constraints

**Timeline:** Case study interview preparation  
**Resources:** Solo PM work (no access to data yet, no designer)  
**Scope:** 6-week implementation with 2 engineers (for interview scenario)  
**Discovery:** Qualitative insights gathered, quantitative data pending  
**Platform:** Fleek Sort rolling out end of March (enables new use cases)

---

## Working Assumptions (For Interview Prep)

Since we don't have data, for interview prep we need to:
1. Present data analysis approach (how we'd diagnose which persona)
2. Show multiple scenarios based on which persona has problem
3. Demonstrate hypothesis-driven thinking
4. Acknowledge unknowns explicitly

**OR** should we wait for actual data before finalizing prep materials?

## Team Context

**Hugh's Role:** Product Manager candidate (interview scenario)  
**Hannah's Role:** PM at Fleek (interviewer, buyer-side focus)  
**Sanket's Role:** Founder (provided company context)

**Interview Format:**
- Data analysis component (24 hours before in-person)
- Live solution design and mockup session
- Scheduled for end of next week (Thursday/Friday)
