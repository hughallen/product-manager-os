# Decisions Log - Fleek Activation Initiative

**Last Updated:** February 16, 2026

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Focus on Evidence-Based Approach
**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Decision:** Do NOT assume which persona has the activation problem. Use data to determine.

**Rationale:**
- Hannah said "first time users" need faster aha moment, but didn't specify which segment
- Could be Beginners (new resellers), Scale (full-time), or Wholesale (retailers) when first joining
- Fabricated assumptions led to incorrect prioritization initially
- Need data analysis before solution design

**Confidence:** High (correcting a critical error)

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ More rigorous, data-driven approach
- ✅ Prevents solving wrong problem
- ❌ Requires data analysis step before solutions
- ❌ Can't pre-design solutions for interview

### Decision 2: Structure Work Using Dual-Track Model
**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Decision:** Organize initiative with Discovery Track (user research, opportunities) and Delivery Track (specs, designs, tasks) as per AGENTS.md

**Rationale:**
- AGENTS.md defines clear dual-track structure
- Separates continuous discovery from sprint-based delivery
- Need to reorganize existing files into proper structure
- Enables better context tracking and handoffs

**Confidence:** High (following workspace standards)

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Clearer organization
- ✅ Follows workspace conventions
- ❌ Requires file reorganization
- ❌ Some duplication (personas both company-wide and initiative-specific)

---

### Decision 3: Use Persona-Generator Framework
**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Decision:** Ground all persona work in evidence with explicit validation levels (✅ Validated, ⚠️ Assumed, ❓ Unknown)

**Rationale:**
- Initially made too many assumptions about personas
- Fabricated Hannah quote about "overwhelming" beginners
- Persona-generator.mdc requires evidence rigor
- Strategic copilot principle: "Evidence over opinion"

**Confidence:** High (correcting methodology)

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ More honest about unknowns
- ✅ Clearer what needs data validation
- ❌ Less confident-sounding recommendations
- ❌ More "we don't know" statements

### Decision 4: Keep Planning Docs as Hypotheses
**Date:** February 16, 2026 (pending)  
**Decision:** Reframe activation-improvement-plan.md and experiment-ideas.md as hypotheses pending data validation

**Rationale:**
- Current plans assume Persona 1 (Beginner) is the problem
- Need to make conditional: "IF data shows Persona 1 is the problem, THEN..."
- Maintains strategic thinking while acknowledging unknowns

**Confidence:** Medium (need to review how this affects interview prep)

**Status:** Pending implementation

## Open Questions

1. **For case study:** Should we present multiple scenarios (if Persona 1 has problem vs Persona 2 vs Persona 3)?
2. **File organization:** Should personas be company-wide OR initiative-specific? (Currently both)
3. **Planning docs:** How much pre-work is valuable vs waiting for data?
4. **Scope:** Does "first-time users" mean literally first-time on platform, or first-time making purchases?

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Didn't read AGENTS.md first** - Skipped onboarding, violated core principles
2. **Didn't follow strategic copilot** - Made assumptions instead of asking clarifying questions
3. **Fabricated evidence** - Created quotes that don't exist in source material ("New users find it overwhelming")
4. **Assumed without flagging** - Stated "Persona 1 has activation problem" as fact when evidence was ambiguous
5. **Used skill without core principles** - Jumped to persona-generator.mdc without strategic copilot guardrails

### What to Do Differently
1. **Always start with AGENTS.md** when encountering new workspace
2. **Activate strategic copilot (alwaysApply: true)** before any work
3. **Follow hierarchy:** AGENTS → Strategic Copilot → Core Workflow → Skill (if needed)
4. **Use evidence markers** (✅ ⚠️ ❓) on every claim
5. **Ask clarifying questions** when uncertain rather than assume
6. **Check source material** - Only cite actual quotes
7. **Skills are tools, not shortcuts** - Keep core principles active when using skills

### Documentation Updates Made
- **AGENTS.md** now includes explicit File Hierarchy section (Core vs Skills)
- **AGENTS.md** now documents this Fleek session as learning example
- **Getting Started** rewritten with 8-step onboarding emphasizing strategic copilot
- Future AI sessions will see these guardrails immediately

## Next Decisions Needed

1. How to structure file organization (move personas into initiative vs keep company-wide)?
2. Whether to present multiple persona scenarios in case study prep?
3. How to handle planning docs that were built on faulty assumptions?
