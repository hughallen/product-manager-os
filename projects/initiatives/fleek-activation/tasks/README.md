# Tasks - Delivery Track

**Purpose:** Implementation task breakdown for engineering

---

## Current State

**Status:** No tasks created yet - too early in process

**Reason:** Need data → solutions → specs → THEN tasks

---

## Task Generation Workflow (Per AGENTS.md)

When ready to build:

1. **Generate tasks** from PRD using:  
   `@pm-toolkit/6-delivery/generate-tasks.mdc`

2. **Process task list** using:  
   `@pm-toolkit/6-delivery/process-task-list.mdc`

3. **Create handoffs** for engineering:  
   `@pm-toolkit/6-delivery/handoffs/to-engineering.mdc`

---

## For Case Study (6-Week Implementation)

**Resources:** 2 engineers  
**Timeline:** 6 weeks (3 x 2-week sprints)

**Sprint Breakdown (Hypothetical):**
- Sprint 1: Quick wins (trust signals, rating transparency)
- Sprint 2: Discovery improvements (browse, search, filters)  
- Sprint 3: Affordability (small bundle surfacing, guided flow)

**Task Estimation Needed:**
- Frontend vs backend split
- Design dependencies
- QA approach
- Rollout strategy (% of users, A/B test)

---

## Next Steps

1. After solutions validated and specs created
2. Break down into 2-week sprint increments
3. Estimate engineering effort
4. Prioritize by impact × feasibility
5. Create engineering handoff docs
