# Fleek Activation Case Study

**Initiative Owner:** Hugh Allen
**Timeline:** 6 weeks
**Resources:** 2 engineers
**Status:** Planning / Interview Prep

---

## Problem Statement

**From Hannah (PM):**
- "Strong acquisition but weak activation/retention" (Sanket)
- "Retention rates kind of plateauing, dropping a little bit over time"
- "Need to get our first time users to the kind of value moment or the aha moment as quickly as possible"
- "That first time experience and the first time purchase" needs work
- Onboarding launched with "slight lift but nothing meaningful"

**Business Impact:**
- Acquisition scaling but not converting/retaining ("pouring water into a leaky bucket")
- Revenue limited by retention, not acquisition

**⚠️ Critical Unknown:** Which user segment(s) have the activation problem? Hannah said "first time users" but this could be first-time users across any of Fleek's 3 customer segments (Beginner, Scale, Wholesale). Need data to determine.

---

## Objectives

### Primary Goal
Increase first-time user activation (completing first purchase within 30 days)

### Secondary Goals
- Reduce time to first purchase
- Improve first → second purchase conversion
- Build foundation for long-term retention

---

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- First-time user experience (signup → first purchase)
- Trust and legitimacy signals
- Product transparency and clarity
- Onboarding improvements
- Quick wins addressable in 6 weeks with 2 engineers

**Out of Scope:**
- Post-purchase experience (order tracking, delivery)
- Web platform overhaul (desktop experience)
- Women's wear hand-pick experience (requires Fleek Sort rollout)
- Supplier relationship tools
- Monetization optimization

## Key Insights (Summary)

### User Feedback Themes
1. **Trust & Legitimacy Anxiety** - Platform looks like scam, need human validation
2. **Financial Risk** - Bundle minimums (£400-500) exceed new reseller budgets (£200)
3. **Product Uncertainty** - Example photos misleading, bundle contents unclear
4. **Supplier Rating Opacity** - Can't understand what drives ratings
5. **Search/Browse Friction** - Browse-first behavior, cart performance issues

### UX Audit Findings
**Critical Issues:**
- Design inconsistency severely lowers trust (blurry graphics, inconsistent branding)
- Bad reviews surfaced at top of listings
- No feedback loop after personalization questions
- Onboarding doesn't explain why questions are asked
- Pricing confusion (bundles + sliding scale)

**Competitor Advantages:**
- Depop: Beautiful onboarding, immediate personalization feedback
- Grailed: Clear personalization → homepage reward loop
- Etsy: Modular product details, seller transparency (years active, sales)
- Vinted: Showcase quality items first, buyer protection visibility

## Next Steps

1. **Data Analysis** (24 hours before interview)
   - Segment users by budget, order size, behavior
   - Map drop-off points in funnel
   - Validate which persona(s) have activation problem
   - Prioritize blockers by impact

2. **Solution Design** (Live interview session)
   - Address top 2-3 blockers within 6-week scope
   - Design for trust, transparency, affordability
   - Leverage Fleek Sort opportunity (100% inventory online by end March)
   - Show experiment approach and metrics

3. **Implementation Planning**
   - Break into 2-week sprints
   - Quick wins vs. strategic bets
   - Build → Measure → Learn cycles

---

## Success Criteria (TBD - Data Dependent)

Will be defined after analyzing:
- Current activation rates by segment
- Drop-off points in funnel
- Time to first purchase baseline
- Which persona(s) to prioritize

---

## Constraints

**Timeline:** 6 weeks
**Resources:** 2 engineers (no designer mentioned - assume engineering-led or PM designs)
**Discovery:** Already completed (qualitative insights validated)
**Fleek Sort:** Rolling out end of March (timing aligns with case study)

**Balancing Act:**
- New reseller activation vs. existing user experience
- Short-term conversion vs. long-term quality/trust
- Engineering feasibility vs. ideal solution
