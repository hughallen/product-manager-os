- German funds (Depop/Vinted backgrounds)
- eBay (strategic investment - significant check)
- Declined Vinted investment (conflict of interest)

## Business Model

### Two-Sided Marketplace

**Buyers (Demand Side):**
- UK, Western Europe, US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand
- 300,000+ resellers and retailers using platform
- Range from £200 budgets (new resellers, 16-18 years old) to £10-30k/month (large retailers)
- Mix of Depop/Instagram resellers, vintage shops, brick-and-mortar stores

**Bundle Sizes Available:**
- **Boxes:** 50-100 items for regular rotation
- **Bales:** 100-400 items for best per-unit cost when scaling volume
- **Custom:** Bulk orders up to 10,000 pieces

**Suppliers (Supply Side):**
- 1,000+ verified suppliers from 10 countries
- Primarily based in Pakistan, India, Dubai (Middle East)
- Quality scores ranging from 4.5-4.9/5 stars
- Dispatch times from 2-9 days
- Process western donations into sorted inventory

### Supply Chain Innovation
**Unique Discovery:**
- Western clothing donations don't stay in West - shipped to East for processing
- Suppliers don't understand fashion value - selling premium items for pennies
- Fleek identified 10x-20x price increase opportunity on premium inventory (5-10% of total)

**Traditional Flow Before Fleek:**
- Buyers traveled to Pakistan/Dubai to source
- Manual relationships, no continuity
- High risk, high friction

**Fleek's Solution:**
- Digital marketplace eliminating travel
- Continuous, reliable inventory sourcing (never reliant on single supplier)
- Bulk purchasing (500+ items common, some buyers ordering 10,000 pieces)
- Comprehensive buyer protection policy
- End-to-end logistics (shipping, customs clearance, secure payments)
- Multi-language support (English, Français, Deutsch)

## AI Transformation: Fleek Sort

**The Problem:**
- Suppliers process 500,000 pieces/day (single factory)
- Many workers illiterate, no fashion knowledge
- Can't teach grading at required scale

**The Solution:**
- Fleek Sort app: Photo recognition for automated grading
- 3 images per item (front, back, label)
- Custom-built model (LLMs too expensive at scale - token costs prohibitive)
- **Goal:** 100% inventory online by end of March 2026

**Impact:**
- Transforms from offline demand-posting to full e-commerce
- Enables individual piece purchasing (not just bulk)
- Unlocks women's wear market (70% of fashion revenue, currently only 20-30% of Fleek revenue)

## Pricing & Monetization

### Dynamic Pricing System
- Suppliers provide price ranges (min/max)
- Fleek controls final pricing (new capability)
- Price decay logic over 24-48 hours
- Bulk discount scaling (10%, 15%, 20% off)
- Platform fee structure (currently more loss-stemming than proactive monetization)

### Revenue Model
- Commission on transactions
- Platform fees (small buyer fees)
- Revenue comes from retention, not just acquisition

## Current Challenges

### 1. Activation & Retention (PRIMARY FOCUS)
- **Problem:** Strong acquisition but weak activation/retention
- **Symptoms:** 
  - Retention rates plateauing/dropping
  - First-time users find it overwhelming, don't know where to start
  - Launched onboarding with only slight lift
  - Discovery completed but engineering pulled to AI project
- **Impact:** "Pouring water into a leaky bucket" - acquisition scaling but not converting/retaining
- **Priority:** Highest-leverage problem to solve (compounds across every cohort)

### 2. Web Platform Underinvestment
- Currently just acquisition tool → hard push to app
- Big spenders (£3-5k transactions) prefer laptop browsing
- Older demographics (40-60+ shop owners) less mobile-native
- Needs platform strategy rethink

### 3. Resource Constraints
- Fleek Sort (AI project) absorbed all resources across domains
- Activation work paused mid-discovery
- Ruthless prioritization required

### 4. Post-AI Opportunities (Lower Priority)
- Search and discovery overhaul needed
- Order tracking and post-purchase experience gaps
- Monetization optimization (commission structure, platform fees)

## Customer Segments

### New Resellers
- **Age:** 16-18 years old
- **Budget:** £200 pocket money
- **Behavior:** Starting reselling because Fleek lowers barrier
- **Challenge:** Find platform overwhelming, don't know where to start

### Small-Medium Resellers
- Side hustles or early-stage businesses
- Moderate spending

### Large Retailers
- **Examples:** Brooklyn vintage shops, UK brick-and-mortar stores
- **Spending:** £10-30k/month
- **Orders:** 500-10,000 pieces at a time
- **Behavior:** 
  - Prefer web/laptop for large transactions
  - Need continuity and reliability
  - Repeat purchasing patterns

### Women's Wear Buyers
- **Style:** Very curated, aesthetic-driven
- **Behavior:** Hand-pick style experience, not bulk
- **Opportunity:** 70% of fashion revenue, only 20-30% of Fleek's current revenue

## Strategic Priorities

### Near-Term (Q1 2026)
1. Complete Fleek Sort rollout (100% inventory online by end of March)
2. **Solve activation problem** (case study focus)
3. Build UK engineering team for growth initiatives

### Medium-Term
- Unlock women's wear market (curated purchasing)
- Search and discovery overhaul
- Web platform strategy
- Post-purchase experience improvements

### Long-Term
- Monetization optimization
- Experiment-driven culture establishment
- Scale to $25M+ revenue

## Team Structure

### Product Team
- **Hannah** (London): PM for buyer side
  - Split: Growth (acquisition, activation, retention, monetization) + Core Product (web/mobile)
  - 1 year tenure
- **3-4 PMs in Karachi:** Supply, finance, ops, customer experience
- Distributed: London + Karachi

### Culture
- Very in-person culture (flexible but expected)
- Mission-driven (sustainability, climate focus)
- Many ex-resellers on team
- Building UK engineering team for growth

## Growth Team Goals

### Success Metrics
1. **Strategic thinking:** Define what to work on based on data (qual + quant)
2. **Experimentation culture:** Full experiment loop (design → run → analyze → decide)
3. **Business impact:** Metrics movement over shipping volume
4. **Revenue focus:** Commercial outcomes, not just acquisition

### Working Style
- Fast experiment cadence (not big infrastructure builds)
- Tight experiments with clear hypotheses
- Data-driven decision making
- End-to-end ownership of growth domain

## Competitive Context

### Supply Side
- **Unique moat:** On-ground presence in Pakistan, India, Dubai
- Relationships + technology + process + language
- Hard to replicate without being on ground

### Buyer Side
- **Competitors:** Depop, Vinted, Poshmark, eBay, Etsy (all C2C)
- **Differentiation:** 
  - B2B wholesale scale (not C2C retail)
  - Bulk purchasing (50-10,000 items vs. individual pieces)
  - Reliable, continuous supply from 1,000+ verified suppliers
  - AI features (Fleeky matching, Fleek Sort grading)
  - Social platform features (chat, make offer, video hand picks)
  - Demand Hub (request unlisted inventory)
  - Upcycled collections (unique value-add)
- **Positioning:** "Alibaba of secondhand fashion" / "Premier vintage wholesale marketplace"
- **First-of-its-kind:** Platform recognized in TechCrunch as pioneering model

## Key Insights

1. **Supply-constrained marketplace** - Can't manufacture secondhand items, must aggregate supply
2. **Fleek is expanding the market** - New resellers starting because of lowered barriers (300,000+ users)
3. **CAC vs. retention mismatch** - Acquiring users but not converting/retaining (activation problem)
4. **Women's wear = massive opportunity** - 70% of market, 20-30% of Fleek revenue
5. **Big spenders prefer web** - £3-5k transactions happen on laptops, not phones
6. **AI enables transformation** - Moving from offline to full e-commerce with 100% inventory online
7. **Proven ROI when activated** - Users report 70% profit margin increases and £16,500+ revenue in 3 months
8. **Platform maturity** - Feature-rich (Fleeky AI, Video Handpicks, Demand Hub, Make Offer, Upcycled) but activation gap prevents users from discovering value

## Constraints for Case Study

- **Timeline:** 6 weeks
- **Resources:** 2 engineers
- **Focus:** First-time user conversion (activation)
- **Context:** Discovery completed, need to ship solution
