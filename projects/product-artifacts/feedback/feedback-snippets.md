**1. Trust, “Scam” Anxiety, and Legitimacy**

- “It seemed like such a scam to me like just the way it like presented itself… it just screams like red flag to me. I just thought, oh, that’s just kind of like, you know, but when you read into it, it’s kind of like you obviously it’s actually a marketplace.”
- “It kind of sounded too good to be true… I didn’t want to get catfished. It wasn’t until I spoke to someone physically that I had the trust to do it.”
- “I was a bit sketchy at first because I did look at reviews and stuff and the reviews weren’t always very positive… I heard a lot of people that they got wrong orders… and they got dirty clothes or fake clothes.”
- “It’s quite scary just knowing that there’s so many fakes about and they won’t be picked up. …The main selling point for me when I started buying on Fleek was that everything would be authentic and it come out at quality control… but then if it’s not going to then that element of trust is definitely removed.”

**2. Confusion Over the Rating System**

- “I can never really figure out exactly what’s caused that score to be low. …Was it delivery time? Don’t know. Was it… for any reason… I figure that the score should just I should know why they’ve got a bad score because at least then if I know what their bad points are, I can try and mitigate it.”
- “I messaged them and was like why… are you so lowly rated? They went we’ve just had canceled orders but I kind of still didn’t trust it… I didn’t really have transparency on fully why they were so lowly rated.”
- “In terms of understanding the star rating, I don’t know if it I don’t I don’t really know what it means. …It’s hard to differentiate between like a mediocre order and a very good order cuz a mediocre could be perceived as three and then a half decent order could be four even though there’s only one number.”
- “So see this rating here product quality and supplier service. Is that like two different ratable? …I can’t really tell what has gone into that, what constitutes their rating… I don’t know what algorithm has gone into giving them a specific rating out of five.”

**3. Product Uncertainty and “Example” Photos**

- “I weren’t sure 100%… is the listing I’ve selected is that just generic and I won’t receive the actual items in the photograph. …I saw the same picture on multiple listings. So, obviously, you can’t sell the same exact item twice.”
- “I’ve got no idea specifically how many units are going to be small, how many going to be medium, what material they’re going to be. so that it’ be nice to have a bit more transparency on that.”
- “They adverted as vintage jeans and then they put a bunch of brands behind them… and then you get four jeans that are unbranded… brands that weren’t even in the description… For newer buyers, that would be an issue if they expect a bunch of branded jeans and they get one branded jeans instead of five.”
- “I was quite surprised when I got quite a lot of kids stuff but I didn’t check the description… I couldn’t really tell if it was just a small adult size or a kids size. And then there wasn’t really anything to compare it to.”

**4. Financial Risk for Small Buyers**

- “A lot of the higher priced things are out of my price range because they’re such big bundles. So maybe… if they had smaller bottles which were cheaper, I’d be thinking, all right, okay, I can pick them up… I think a lot of the more expensive things you’re looking 4, 500 and it’s not something I can do at the minute.”
- “I don’t start with an order of 500 that’s just too risky. …When I find a new supplier I would like to try I do a small order of €50 so I can see how does it arrive.”

**5. Friction in Search and UI**

- “I don’t go on the app knowing what I’m looking for. So when I go on there, I don’t know what I’m searching for… so the search to me there’s nothing for me to put in. so I don’t think I’ve ever used it to be honest.”
- “I think on desktop it’s not the best. I think it definitely needs improved… there’s loads of suppliers in there as well. But fleek’s kind of one that always pops up because it’s so easy to kind of find what you’re looking for.”
- “The basket takes like really long time to like updates. So once I’m like trying to like actually check out and then I’ll need to remove some of the stuff… It just gives me like a lot of time in spinning spinning spinning.”
