# Fleek Buyer Personas

**Data Sources:** 
- **Fleek's website** (joinfleek.com) - customer segments and value propositions
- Leadership interviews: Hannah (PM), Sanket (Founder)
- User feedback interviews (qualitative feedback - 5 themes, direct quotes)

**Generated:** February 16, 2026  
**Updates existing:** No - created from scratch for case study

---

## Context

**What I found in project files:**
- **Existing personas:** None - creating from scratch
- **Product context:** Fleek - B2B vintage wholesale marketplace
- **Current user base:** 300,000+ resellers and retailers (from website)
- **Key problem:** Strong acquisition but weak activation/retention (Hannah)

---

## Fleek's 3 Customer Segments (From Website)

Fleek explicitly defines 3 buyer segments:

### 1. "Start reselling vintage on Fleek"
**Target:** Beginners, new to reselling
**Value prop:** "Finding your first supplier is often the hardest part of reselling. Fleek makes it easier with access to 1,000+ verified vintage suppliers. Start small with beginner-friendly bundles, test what sells, and grow at your own pace."
**Features:** Small MOQs (10-20 pieces), verified suppliers, buyer protection

### 2. "Scale your reselling business"
**Target:** Full-time resellers with established shops
**Value prop:** "Scaling is tough when supply is unreliable. Fleek helps full-time resellers grow with consistent bulk stock and advanced sourcing tools so you can focus on building your shop."
**Features:** High-demand categories (Levi's 501s, Y2K, sportswear), Demand Hub, Virtual Handpick (video calls, moodboards), supplier relationships

### 3. "Wholesale vintage stock for shops & online stores"
**Target:** Retailers and multi-channel businesses
**Value prop:** "Fleek makes sourcing reliable vintage supply simple for retailers and multi-channel businesses. Connect with 1,000+ verified suppliers, plan seasonal drops with Demand Hub, and handpick bundles that match your shop's aesthetic."
**Features:** Transparent grading, Demand Hub for planning, handpick with suppliers, representative photos

## The Activation Problem (From Hannah)

**What we know:**
- "Strong acquisition but weak activation/retention" (Sanket)
- "Retention rates kind of plateauing, dropping a little bit over time" (Hannah)
- "Need to get our first time users to the kind of value moment or the aha moment as quickly as possible" (Hannah)
- "That first time experience and the first time purchase" is the focus (Hannah)
- Onboarding launched with "slight lift but nothing meaningful" (case study notes)

**⚠️ CRITICAL UNKNOWN: Which persona has the activation problem?**

Hannah said "first time users" need faster path to aha moment. But "first time users" could mean:
- First-time Beginner Resellers (Persona 1)?
- First-time Scale Resellers (Persona 2)?
- First-time Wholesale Retailers (Persona 3)?
- All three segments when they first join Fleek?

**We need data to determine:**
1. What % of signups are each persona?
2. Activation rate by persona (Persona 1 vs 2 vs 3)
3. Where each persona drops off in the funnel
4. Which persona(s) have significantly worse activation

---

## Platform Optimization (From Hannah)

**What works well:**
> "We've only really been able to cater to one [buying style], which is our kind of bulk menswear, like brand purchase journeys" (Hannah)

**What's underserved:**
> "A lot of our women's web buyers are very curated in the way that they purchase. They are very kind of aesthetic and style driven. They don't just want a hundred like Nike splash proof jackets, they want a hundred pieces that they have specifically chosen themselves." (Hannah)

- Women's wear is 70% of fashion revenue but only 20-30% of Fleek's revenue (Hannah)
- Platform optimized for bulk menswear (likely serves Persona 2 - Scale Resellers well)
- Women's wear buyers underserved (Persona 4 - opportunity, not current activation problem)

# Persona 1: Beginner Reseller

**Fleek Segment:** "Start reselling vintage on Fleek"  
**Role:** New to vintage reselling  
**Segment:** ❓ Unknown demographics (need data)  
**Budget:** ❓ Unknown (user feedback suggests £50-200 range)  
**Experience Level:** New to reselling entirely  
**Persona Type:** Buyer + User

## Overview

**From Fleek's website:** "Finding your first supplier is often the hardest part of reselling. Fleek makes it easier with access to 1,000+ verified vintage suppliers. Start small with beginner-friendly bundles, test what sells, and grow at your own pace."

New to vintage reselling. Looking to start side hustle (Vinted, Depop, eBay, local markets). No wholesale experience. Limited budget. Testing if reselling is viable before committing more money.

## Use Scenarios (Pragmatic Format)

| Persona | Goal | Problem | Frequency |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| Beginner | Find first trusted supplier | ⚠️ Assumed: Platform seems "scammy", lack of trust | First-time |
| Beginner | Test what sells with minimal risk | ⚠️ Assumed: Limited budget, can't afford mistakes | First 1-3 purchases |
| Beginner | Understand what's in bundles | Product uncertainty (from user feedback) | Every browse session |
| Beginner | Build confidence in platform | Trust deficit (from user feedback) | Before first purchase |

## Jobs-to-be-Done

**Primary (⚠️ Assumed - needs validation):**
- "When I want to start reselling vintage, I want to find a trustworthy first supplier with small MOQs, so I can test if this business works without risking too much money."

**Secondary (⚠️ Assumed):**
- "When browsing suppliers, I want to see ratings and understand what they mean, so I know they're legitimate."
- "When choosing products, I want to know exactly what's in the bundle, so I don't get surprised."

## Goals (⚠️ Assumed - need validation)

- Start reselling side hustle with minimal risk
- Test viability before committing more money
- Learn what sells before scaling
- Build confidence in platform/suppliers

## Frustrations (✅ Validated from user feedback)

**Trust & Legitimacy:**
> "It seemed like such a scam to me like just the way it like presented itself… it just screams like red flag to me."

> "It kind of sounded too good to be true… I didn't want to get catfished. It wasn't until I spoke to someone physically that I had the trust to do it."

> "I was a bit sketchy at first because I did look at reviews and stuff and the reviews weren't always very positive… I heard a lot of people that they got wrong orders… and they got dirty clothes or fake clothes."

**Rating System Confusion:**
> "I can never really figure out exactly what's caused that score to be low. …Was it delivery time? Don't know."

> "I messaged them and was like why… are you so lowly rated? They went we've just had canceled orders but I kind of still didn't trust it… I didn't really have transparency on fully why they were so lowly rated."

**Product Uncertainty:**
> "I weren't sure 100%… is the listing I've selected is that just generic and I won't receive the actual items in the photograph."

> "I've got no idea specifically how many units are going to be small, how many going to be medium, what material they're going to be."

**Financial Risk:**
> "A lot of the higher priced things are out of my price range because they're such big bundles. So maybe… if they had smaller bottles which were cheaper, I'd be thinking, all right, okay, I can pick them up… I think a lot of the more expensive things you're looking 4, 500 and it's not something I can do at the minute."

> "I don't start with an order of 500 that's just too risky. …When I find a new supplier I would like to try I do a small order of €50 so I can see how does it arrive."

**Search/Browse Friction:**
> "I don't go on the app knowing what I'm looking for. So when I go on there, I don't know what I'm searching for… so the search to me there's nothing for me to put in. so I don't think I've ever used it to be honest."

## Behaviors

**Triggers (⚠️ Assumed):**
- Want to start reselling side hustle
- Saw others succeed on Depop/Vinted
- Need extra income

**Workflow (⚠️ Assumed - needs behavioral data):**
1. Download app / land on website
2. Browse (don't know what to search for - browse-first behavior)
3. Try to evaluate suppliers (rating system confusing)
4. Look at bundles (product uncertainty, trust concerns)
5. **❓ Unknown: Where do they drop off?**

**Frequency (❓ Unknown):** Need data on conversion rate

## Evidence

### ✅ Validated (Persona Exists)
- Website explicitly targets this segment: "Start reselling vintage on Fleek"
- Features built for them: "small MOQs (10-20 pieces) to reduce risk", buyer protection, verified suppliers

### ❓ CRITICAL UNKNOWNS - Need Data
**Does this persona have the activation problem?**
- What % of signups are Persona 1 (Beginner)?
- What is Persona 1 activation rate vs Persona 2/3?
- Where do they drop off in funnel?
- Are the user feedback quotes from Persona 1, or from other personas?
- Do they find the 10-20 piece bundles mentioned on website, or only see £400-500 bundles?

| Product uncertainty | Better bundle previews, representative photos, size breakdowns | ✅ User quotes |
| Rating confusion | Explain what drives ratings, breakdown by delivery/quality/service | ✅ User quotes |
| Budget constraints | Surface 10-20 piece bundles (£50-200 range) prominently | ✅ User quotes |
| Browse-first behavior | Guided discovery, categories, "popular with beginners" | ⚠️ Assumed from 1 quote |

# Persona 4: Women's Boutique Owner - OPPORTUNITY

**Role:** Women's vintage boutique owner (curated aesthetic)  
**Segment:** ❓ Unknown  
**Budget:** ❓ Unknown  
**Experience Level:** ❓ Unknown  
**Status:** 🔮 UNDERSERVED - 70% market opportunity, 20-30% of revenue

## Overview

**From Hannah:**
> "Women's market is 70% of fashion revenue but only 20-30% of Fleek revenue"

> "A lot of our women's web buyers are very curated in the way that they purchase. They are very kind of aesthetic and style driven. They don't just want a hundred like Nike splash proof jackets, they want a hundred pieces that they have specifically chosen themselves."

> "We've only really been able to cater to one [buying style], which is our kind of bulk menswear, like brand purchase journeys"

Owns women's vintage boutique (physical shop or online) with strong aesthetic identity. Needs wholesale volumes but with HIGH curation focus. Platform currently optimized for bulk menswear, not curated women's wear.

## Evidence

### ✅ Validated (Opportunity Exists)
- "Women's market is 70% of fashion revenue but only 20-30% of Fleek revenue" (Hannah)
- "Women's web buyers are very curated... very aesthetic and style driven" (Hannah)
- "We've only been able to cater to bulk menswear buyers" (Hannah)
- Gap between market size (70%) and Fleek capture (20-30%) = underserved

### ❓ CRITICAL UNKNOWNS
- Does this persona exist in current user base?
- Are they signing up and dropping off during activation?
- Or is this acquisition gap (they don't know about Fleek)?
- Is this an activation problem or product-market-fit gap?
- What would they need to activate?

### 🔮 Future Opportunity
**When unlocked:** Post-Fleek Sort rollout (end March 2026) enables individual piece curation
**Product needs:** 
- Women's wear category expansion (supplier recruitment)
- Aesthetic/style filtering (Y2K, boho, cottagecore, etc.)
- Curated bundles (100-500 pieces with aesthetic coherence)
- Supplier specialization visibility

**Business Impact:** Could unlock 50%+ revenue growth by capturing 70% fashion market share

## For Case Study

**This persona is OUT OF SCOPE:**
- Not an activation problem (product-market-fit gap - platform not built for them)
- Mention as "strategic future opportunity" after solving actual activation problem
- Shows strategic thinking: prioritize what's measurable now (Personas 1-3), capture market opportunity later

---

# Anti-Persona: Individual Consumers

**Who:** People looking to buy single vintage items for personal use (not reselling)

**Why Not:** 
- Fleek is B2B wholesale marketplace
- Minimum order quantities (10-20 pieces minimum)
- Pricing structured for bulk purchases
- Features built for business buyers (Demand Hub, supplier relationships, volume discounts)

**Risk if We Target Them:**
- Confuse platform positioning
- Poor conversion (they can't buy single items)
- Support burden (explaining MOQs, wholesale model)
- Distract from core B2B value prop

# Activation Problem - Root Causes

## What We Know (✅ Validated)

**The Problem (from leadership):**
- "Strong acquisition but weak activation/retention" (Sanket)
- "Retention rates kind of plateauing, dropping a little bit over time" (Hannah)
- "Need to get our first time users to the kind of value moment or the aha moment as quickly as possible" (Hannah)
- "That first time experience and the first time purchase" needs work (Hannah)
- Onboarding launched with "slight lift but nothing meaningful"

**User Feedback Themes (✅ Validated with quotes):**

1. **Trust & Legitimacy** - Platform seems like scam, bad reviews visible, QC concerns
2. **Rating System Confusion** - Can't understand what drives ratings, opacity
3. **Product Uncertainty** - Example photos misleading, bundle contents unclear, size confusion
4. **Financial Risk** - Bundles too expensive (£400-500 vs £50-200 budget), can't test small
5. **Search/Browse Friction** - Browse-first users ("don't know what I'm searching for"), desktop poor

**Platform Optimization (✅ Validated from Hannah):**
- Works well for: "bulk menswear buying journeys"
- Underserved: "curated, aesthetic-driven women's wear buyers"

## ❓ CRITICAL UNKNOWNS - Need Data to Answer

**Persona Diagnosis:**
1. What % of signups are Persona 1 vs 2 vs 3?
2. Which persona(s) have the activation problem?
3. Activation rate by persona (signup → first purchase)?
4. Is it one persona, or all personas when "first time" on Fleek?

**Funnel Diagnosis:**
5. Where do users drop off? (Signup → Browse → Supplier Page → Bundle Page → Cart → Checkout)
6. What % complete each stage?
7. Does drop-off point vary by persona?

**Root Cause Validation:**
8. Are users priced out? (Do they only see £400+ bundles when budget is £50-200?)
9. Is trust the blocker? (Do users who view reviews convert less?)
10. Is product uncertainty the blocker? (Do users who view bundle details drop off?)
11. Does rating confusion matter? (Correlation between rating views and conversion?)
12. Is it overwhelming choice? (Do users browse extensively but never click suppliers?)
13. Does desktop vs mobile matter? (Persona 3 activation on web vs app?)

**User Feedback Attribution:**
14. Which persona(s) gave the user feedback quotes? (Trust, uncertainty, budget concerns)
15. Are small MOQ bundles (10-20 pieces, £50-200) actually visible on platform?
16. If visible, do users find them, or only see £400-500 bundles?

**Opportunity Sizing:**
17. If we improve activation by 20-30%, what's revenue impact?
18. Which persona improvements have highest ROI?
19. What's the revenue split by persona today (1 vs 2 vs 3)?

## Next Steps for Case Study

### 1. Data Analysis (24 hours before interview)

**Segment users by persona indicators:**
- Budget/order size (Persona 1: <£500, Persona 2: £1k-5k, Persona 3: £3k+)
- Behavioral patterns (browse-first vs search-first, mobile vs desktop)
- Product categories (menswear bulk vs curated women's)

**Map activation funnel by persona:**
- Signup → Browse → Supplier Click → Bundle View → Cart → Checkout
- Calculate conversion rate at each stage for each persona
- Identify which persona(s) have worst activation

**Validate root causes with data:**
- Pricing: Do low-budget users only see expensive bundles?
- Trust: Do users who view ratings convert less?
- Product uncertainty: Do users view many bundles but not add to cart?
- Desktop: Do Persona 3 users on web convert worse than app?

**Prioritize by impact:**
- Which persona represents largest opportunity (volume × conversion potential)?
- Which root cause is most fixable (data-driven prioritization)?

### 2. Case Study Presentation

**Structure:**
1. **Problem:** "First-time users" not activating (but WHO is unknown without data)
2. **Data Diagnosis:** Show which persona(s) have activation problem
3. **Root Cause:** Validate which user feedback themes drive drop-off
4. **Solutions:** Prioritized by persona × root cause × impact
5. **Out of Scope:** Persona 4 (women's boutique) - strategic opportunity, not activation fix

**Show Strategic Thinking:**
- Don't assume Persona 1 is the problem
- Use data to diagnose which persona needs fixing
- Solve measurable activation problem first
- Position Persona 4 as future growth opportunity
