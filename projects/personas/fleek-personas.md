# Fleek Buyer Personas

**Data Sources:** 
- Leadership interviews: Hannah (PM), Sanket (Founder)
- User interview transcripts (qualitative feedback - 5 themes, 13+ quotes)
- Case study brief
- Competitive analysis (Depop, Vinted, Grailed, Etsy, eBay)

**Generated:** February 16, 2026  
**Updates existing:** No - created from scratch for case study

---

## Context

**What I found in project files:**
- **Existing personas:** None - creating from scratch for case study
- **Product context:** Fleek - B2B vintage wholesale marketplace (joinfleek.com)
- **Current user base:** 300,000+ resellers and retailers
- **Activation challenge:** Strong acquisition, weak activation/retention

**Product Overview:**
- Two-sided marketplace: Buyers (resellers/retailers) ↔ Suppliers (1,000+ from 10 countries)
- B2B focus (wholesale bundles 50-10,000 items, not individual consumers)
- Supply chain innovation: Western donations → East processing → global resale
- AI transformation: Fleek Sort (automated grading, 100% inventory online by end March)
- Revenue model: Commission on transactions, comes from retention not acquisition

**The Activation Problem:**
New users (particularly new resellers) find platform "overwhelming and don't know where to start." Onboarding launched with "slight lift but nothing meaningful." Need to activate the right users who will retain.

**What We Know About Current Users (From Interviews):**

**Hannah's Direct Quote:**
> "We've only really been able to cater to one [buying style], which is our kind of bulk menswear, like brand purchase journeys... A lot of our women's web buyers are very curated in the way that they purchase. They are very kind of aesthetic and style driven."

**Translation:**
1. **Current platform optimized for:** Bulk menswear buyers (Jordan-type)
2. **Struggling to activate:** New resellers (Casey-type) - "find it overwhelming and don't know where to start"
3. **Underserved segment:** Women's wear curators (Taylor-type) - exist but only 20-30% of revenue vs 70% market

**The Case Study Focus:**
Fix activation for **new resellers (Casey)** who are being acquired but not converting to first purchase. 

**Persona Summary:**
- **Casey (Primary Focus):** New resellers struggling to activate - THIS IS THE CASE STUDY
- **Jordan (Current, Working):** Large retailers activating fine, secondary improvements (web UX)
- **Taylor (Underserved):** Curated Depop/Instagram resellers - women's wear, hand-picking focus (out of scope)
- **Riley (Target Opportunity):** Women's boutique owners - NEW COHORT representing 70% market opportunity (out of scope)

# Persona 1: New Reseller (Casey)

**Role:** First-time reseller / Side hustler  
**Segment:** Gen Z (16-18 years old), UK/Europe-based  
**Budget:** £200 (pocket money/savings)  
**Experience Level:** Beginner - new to wholesale  
**Persona Type:** Buyer + User (they buy and use the platform)

## Overview

Casey is a Gen Z entrepreneur wanting to start a reselling business on Depop/Vinted. They've sold personal items before but never purchased wholesale. Fleek lowers barriers, but Casey gets overwhelmed and abandons before first purchase. Digital-native (mobile-first) but new to B2B platforms and wholesale pricing.

**Behavioral traits:**
- Browse-first (doesn't know what to search for)
- Risk-averse (£200 budget = no mistakes)
- Needs validation (platform looks "like a scam")
- Price-sensitive (£400-500 bundles exceed budget)

## Use Scenarios (Pragmatic Format)

| Persona | Goal | Problem | Frequency |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| Casey | Find first bundle to purchase | Too many options, don't know what will resell, platform overwhelming | First visit (make-or-break) |
| Casey | Assess if bundle is profitable | Can't see contents clearly, don't know quality, example photos misleading | Every bundle view |
| Casey | Trust Fleek is legitimate | Platform "screams red flag," bad reviews at top, no visible QC, too good to be true | Pre-purchase (blocks conversion) |
| Casey | Purchase first bundle with confidence | Minimums (£400-500) exceed budget (£200), can't test with small order | Once (if affordable) |
| Casey | Understand supplier ratings | Can't figure out what caused low scores, would buy if knew it was just slow shipping | Supplier evaluation |

## Jobs-to-be-Done

**Primary:**
- "When I want to start a reselling business, I want to source quality vintage inventory affordably, so I can make money without traveling to Pakistan."

**Secondary:**
- "When I'm new to wholesale, I want to understand what to buy and how much to spend, so I don't waste my savings."
- "When I'm evaluating inventory, I want to know exactly what's in the bundle, so I can assess if items will sell on Depop."
- "When I'm skeptical of Fleek, I want to see proof it's legitimate, so I can trust the platform with my money."
- "When I can't afford large bundles, I want smaller starter options (£50-100), so I can test before committing."

## Goals

- Start generating income from reselling
- Learn how to source profitable inventory
- Build confidence in buying decisions with limited budget
- Grow from side hustle to sustainable business
- Avoid mistakes (can't afford them)

## Frustrations

**Trust & Legitimacy:**
- Platform looks like a scam at first glance
- Negative reviews surfaced prominently
- Quality control not visible/transparent
- Prices seem "too good to be true" (don't understand wholesale economics)
- Need human validation before trusting

**Financial Risk:**
- Bundle minimums (£400-500) exceed budget (£200)
- Can't afford to test platform with small order
- Mistakes are catastrophic with limited savings
- Want £50-100 "starter bundles" to de-risk

**Product Uncertainty:**
- Example photos misleading (same photo on multiple listings)
- Don't know bundle contents (sizes, brands, materials, quantity)
- Can't assess if items will sell on Depop
- Expectation mismatches (advertised brands don't arrive)

**Overwhelming Experience:**
- Too many options, don't know where to start
- No guidance on what to buy
- Personalization doesn't seem to work (homepage still generic)
- Don't know what to search for (browse-first behavior)

**Rating Opacity:**
- Can't understand what drives supplier ratings
- Would buy from low-rated if knew it was just slow shipping (not quality)
- Lack of transparency blocks decision-making

## Behaviors

**Triggers:**  
- Sees others selling vintage on Depop/Instagram
- Wants side income / entrepreneurship
- Finds Fleek through social media/word of mouth

**Workflow:**
1. Signup (mobile-first)
2. Onboarding (completes personalization but no reward)
3. Homepage (feels generic/overwhelming despite personalization)
4. Browse bundles (confused by example photos, prices)
5. View supplier page (sees bad reviews at top)
6. **Abandons** (overwhelmed + trust barrier + priced out)

**Frequency:** First visit only - drops off before first purchase (activation problem)

## Evidence

### ✅ Validated (Leadership Interviews)
- "New users, particularly those new to reselling entirely, face difficulties getting going on Fleek. They find it overwhelming and don't know where to start." (Case study brief)
- "We've launched onboarding which has driven a slight lift but nothing meaningful." (Case study brief)
- "Fleek is actively expanding the market... people come in, they say, 'I started reselling because I could buy a bundle.'" (Sanket)

### ✅ Validated (User Research - High Confidence)
**Financial constraints:**
> "A lot of the higher priced things are out of my price range because they're such big bundles... if they had smaller bottles which were cheaper, I'd be thinking, all right, okay, I can pick them up… £400-500... not something I can do at the minute."

**Browse-first behavior:**
> "I don't go on the app knowing what I'm looking for. So when I go on there, I don't know what I'm searching for… so the search to me there's nothing for me to put in."

**Mentions "newer buyers" explicitly:**
> "For newer buyers, that would be an issue if they expect a bunch of branded jeans and they get one branded jeans instead of five."

### ✅ Validated (User Research - Likely Casey)
**Trust/scam anxiety:**
> "It seemed like such a scam to me like just the way it like presented itself… it just screams like red flag to me."

> "It kind of sounded too good to be true… I didn't want to get catfished. It wasn't until I spoke to someone physically that I had the trust to do it."

**Product uncertainty:**
> "I weren't sure 100%… is the listing I've selected is that just generic and I won't receive the actual items in the photograph."

**Small test orders:**
> "I don't start with an order of 500 that's just too risky. …When I find a new supplier I would like to try I do a small order of €50 so I can see how does it arrive."

### ⚠️ To Validate with Data
- What % of signups match Casey profile? (budget indicators, browse behavior)
- What % are priced out by £400-500 minimums?
- Does Casey have activation problem or is it Jordan/Taylor?
- Where exactly do Casey-like users drop off in funnel?

## Product Implications

| Insight | Design Implication |
|---------|-------------------|
| Browse-first, don't know what to search | Homepage with curated "Popular with new resellers," category cards, not search-first UI |
| £200 budget, £400-500 minimums | Starter bundles (£50-100) or surface affordable options prominently |
| Platform looks like scam | Professional design quality, visible buyer protection, quality control transparency |
| Bad reviews at top | Adjust review relevance algorithm, don't surface all bad reviews first |
| Example photos misleading | Leverage Fleek Sort (3 images/item) for bundle transparency, clear "example" labeling |
| No personalization feedback | Show "Based on your preferences" section immediately after onboarding |
| Rating opacity | Break down ratings: delivery, quality, communication - enable risk assessment |
| Overwhelming experience | Progressive disclosure, curated entry points, guided first purchase |

## Quotes (Representative)

> "It seemed like such a scam to me like just the way it like presented itself… it just screams like red flag to me."

> "A lot of the higher priced things are out of my price range... £400-500... if they had smaller bottles which were cheaper, I'd be thinking, all right, okay, I can pick them up."

> "I don't go on the app knowing what I'm looking for... I don't know what I'm searching for."

> "It kind of sounded too good to be true… I didn't want to get catfished. It wasn't until I spoke to someone physically that I had the trust to do it."

# Persona 2: Large Retailer (Jordan)

**Role:** Brick-and-mortar vintage shop owner / Large reseller  
**Segment:** 40-60+ years old, UK/Europe/US-based  
**Budget:** £10,000-30,000/month  
**Experience Level:** Expert - established business  
**Persona Type:** Buyer + User (buys and uses for business)

## Overview

Jordan owns an established vintage clothing shop (e.g., Brooklyn vintage store) and needs continuous, reliable inventory. Used to travel to Pakistan/Dubai quarterly to source - now uses Fleek for digital sourcing. High-value customer (£10-30k/month) who generates most revenue once activated. Prefers desktop for large transactions, not super tech-savvy.

**Behavioral traits:**
- Search-first (knows specific brands/categories)
- Business operator (needs continuity and reliability)
- Desktop preference (£3-5k transactions on laptop)
- High retention once activated (where Fleek makes money)

## Use Scenarios (Pragmatic Format)

| Persona | Goal | Problem | Frequency |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| Jordan | Restock shop with bulk inventory | Web experience poor, forced to app, but prefers laptop for large spends | Weekly |
| Jordan | Place £3-5k order with confidence | Limited product views on web, can't inspect at scale | Weekly |
| Jordan | Track order status and delivery | No tracking visibility, blind spot in supply chain | Per order (ongoing anxiety) |
| Jordan | Find specific items (brand/category) | Search not effective enough, results not relevant | Daily browsing |
| Jordan | Build reliable supplier relationships | Want repeat suppliers, priority access, consistent quality | Ongoing (business continuity) |
| Jordan | Understand supplier reliability | Rating system confusing, can't assess delivery vs quality vs communication | Supplier evaluation |

## Jobs-to-be-Done

**Primary:**
- "When I need to restock my shop, I want to source bulk inventory quickly and reliably, so I maintain continuous sales without travel."

**Secondary:**
- "When I'm spending £3-5k on a transaction, I want to browse on my laptop with detailed views, so I can make confident large purchases."
- "When I find a good supplier, I want to build a relationship and get priority access, so I have consistent quality supply."
- "When I need specific items (10,000 Lululemon leggings), I want to communicate my needs, so suppliers can fulfill custom requests."
- "When my order is in transit, I want to track it, so I can plan inventory management and customer commitments."

## Goals

- Maintain continuous inventory flow (business continuity)
- Source quality items at profitable margins
- Build reliable supplier relationships
- Scale business without travel overhead (used to go to Pakistan quarterly)
- Minimize risk with large purchases

## Frustrations

**Web Platform:**
- Platform pushes to app, but prefers laptop for £3-5k transactions
- Desktop experience poor, not optimized for large transactions
- Big spenders (like Jordan) get worse experience

**Operational:**
- Lack of order tracking (can't see delivery status)
- Search limitations (doesn't surface right inventory)
- No supplier relationship tools (want repeat suppliers, priority access)

**Trust & Transparency:**
- Rating system confusing (same as Casey, but different stakes)
- Product uncertainty (even at scale, wants bundle clarity)
- Quality expectations not set upfront

## Behaviors

**Triggers:**
- Regular inventory restocking needs (business operations)
- Seasonal demand (need specific categories)
- Supplier relationship development

**Workflow:**
1. Desktop browse (weekly)
2. Search specific brands/categories
3. Evaluate suppliers (ratings, past purchases)
4. Message suppliers for custom requests
5. Place large order (£3-5k)
6. **Returns weekly** (high retention)

**Frequency:** Weekly active, monthly large purchases

## Evidence

### ✅ Validated (Leadership Interviews)
- "Big spenders (£3-5k transactions) prefer laptop browsing. Older demographics (40-60+ shop owners) less mobile-native." (Hannah)
- "Some of our retailers are buying 10,000 pairs of Lululemon leggings in one go." (Hannah)
- "Used to require travel to Pakistan/Dubai - now digital" (Sanket)
- "Revenue comes from retention" - high LTV customers (Sanket)

### ✅ Validated (User Research - High Confidence)
**Desktop preference:**
> "I think on desktop it's not the best. I think it definitely needs improved... But fleek's kind of one that always pops up because it's so easy to kind of find what you're looking for."

### ✅ Validated (Universal - Affects Jordan Too)
**Rating confusion:**
> "In terms of understanding the star rating, I don't know... It's hard to differentiate between like a mediocre order and a very good order."

### ⚠️ To Validate with Data
- Does Jordan have activation problem or retention problem?
- What % of signups match Jordan profile?
- Is web experience blocking activation or just hurting retention?

## Product Implications

| Insight | Design Implication |
|---------|-------------------|
| Desktop preference for large spends | Invest in web experience, don't force to app |
| Search-first behavior | Optimize search for brands/categories, not just browse |
| Need supplier relationships | Supplier following, repeat supplier tools, priority access |
| Order tracking blind spot | Post-purchase visibility, delivery tracking |
| High LTV once activated | Retention focus, not just activation |
| Rating opacity (universal) | Rating breakdown affects all personas - fix it |

## Quotes

> "Big spenders (£3-5k transactions) prefer laptop browsing. Older demographics (40-60+ shop owners) less mobile-native." — Hannah

> "I think on desktop it's not the best. I think it definitely needs improved."

# Persona 2B: Women's Wear Curator (Taylor) - FUTURE OPPORTUNITY

**Role:** Curated vintage reseller (Depop, Instagram-based)  
**Segment:** 25-35 years old, UK/Europe-based  
**Budget:** £500-2,000/month  
**Experience Level:** Intermediate - established aesthetic/brand  
**Persona Type:** Buyer + User  
**Status:** ⚠️ UNDERSERVED - Exists but platform not optimized for them

## Overview

Taylor sells curated vintage on Depop/Instagram with a specific aesthetic (Y2K, cottagecore, etc.). Currently represents only 20-30% of Fleek's revenue despite women's wear being 70% of fashion market. **Not interested in bulk menswear bundles** - wants to hand-pick individual pieces. Platform hasn't been able to serve this persona effectively yet.

**Key insight from Hannah:** "We've only really been able to cater to bulk menswear buyers... women's wear buyers are very curated, want 100 pieces they've specifically chosen themselves."

**Fleek Sort Unlock:** Individual piece purchasing with 3 images per item (rolling out end of March) will enable Taylor's use case for the first time.

**Behavioral traits:**
- Aesthetic-driven (brand consistency matters)
- Hand-pick focus (not bulk)
- Visual discovery (browse by style, not search)
- Medium budget (£500-2k/month)

## Use Scenarios (Pragmatic Format)

| Persona | Goal | Problem | Frequency |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| Taylor | Hand-pick pieces matching aesthetic | Platform optimized for bulk only, can't select individual items | Would be weekly if possible |
| Taylor | Browse women's wear inventory | Women's wear underserved, mostly menswear on platform | Currently limited |
| Taylor | Build custom curated bundle | Forced into bulk bundles, can't cherry-pick specific pieces | Would do per session if possible |
| Taylor | Ensure authenticity for resale | Need authentication for Depop credibility | Every purchase |

## Jobs-to-be-Done

**Primary:**
- "When I need inventory for my curated shop, I want to hand-pick individual pieces that match my aesthetic, so my brand stays consistent."

**Secondary:**
- "When browsing inventory, I want to see detailed photos (3 angles) and item details, so I can assess fit with my aesthetic."
- "When I find pieces I love, I want to purchase them individually or build custom bundles, so I'm not stuck with unwanted items."

## Goals

- Maintain consistent brand aesthetic
- Source unique, standout pieces
- Build custom collections
- Differentiate from bulk resellers

## Frustrations

- **Current platform doesn't serve this persona:** Optimized for bulk menswear, not curated women's wear
- **Can't hand-pick:** No individual item selection (yet)
- **Women's wear underserved:** Only 20-30% of Fleek revenue despite 70% market opportunity

## Behaviors (Hypothesized - Limited Data)

**Triggers:**  
- Need inventory that matches curated aesthetic
- Depop/Instagram shop needs restocking

**Current Workflow:**
- May not use Fleek at all (not designed for them)
- OR buys bulk and sorts out unwanted items (workaround)

**Frequency:** Would be weekly if experience supported it

## Evidence

### ✅ Validated (Leadership Interviews)
- "Women's market is 70% of fashion revenue but only 20-30% of Fleek revenue" (Hannah)
- "Women's wear buyers are very curated... want 100 pieces they've specifically chosen themselves... very aesthetic and style driven" (Hannah)
- **"We've only been able to cater to bulk menswear buyers"** (Hannah) - Platform not designed for Taylor yet
- Fleek Sort (end March) will enable individual piece purchasing with 3 images per item

### ⚠️ Unknown - Need Data
- What % of current signups match Taylor profile?
- Are they dropping off during activation? Or not even trying Fleek?
- Is this an activation problem or acquisition/product-market-fit problem?
- Will Fleek Sort rollout unlock Taylor cohort?

### 🔮 Future Persona Status
This persona represents **future opportunity**, not current activation problem. Fleek Sort (end March 2026) will unlock hand-picking for first time, enabling Taylor use case.

**For Case Study:** Taylor is NOT the primary focus (that's Casey activation). Mention as future opportunity if Fleek Sort enables new market segment.

## Product Implications (Post-Fleek Sort)

| Insight | Design Implication |
|---------|-------------------|
| Hand-pick focus | Individual item selection powered by Fleek Sort (end March) |
| Visual discovery | Browse by aesthetic/style with 3 images per item |
| Women's wear gap | 70% market opportunity unlocked by Fleek Sort |
| Curated bundles | Custom bundle builder, not fixed bulk bundles |
| **Timeline:** Post-March 2026 (after Fleek Sort rollout) |

---

# Persona 3: Female Brick-and-Mortar Shop Owner (Riley) - POTENTIAL NEW COHORT

**Role:** Women's vintage boutique owner  
**Segment:** 35-50 years old, UK/Europe/US-based  
**Budget:** £3,000-10,000/month  
**Experience Level:** Established business owner  
**Persona Type:** Buyer + User  
**Status:** 🔮 TARGET OPPORTUNITY - Not currently served well by platform

## Overview

Riley owns a women's vintage boutique with a physical storefront. Needs continuous inventory but with more curation than Jordan's bulk menswear approach. Represents the bridge between Jordan (large volume, less curation) and Taylor (highly curated, smaller volume). This is the demographic Hannah mentioned: women's wear is 70% of fashion market but only 20-30% of Fleek's current revenue.

**Key behavioral traits:**
- Business operator (like Jordan) but women's wear focus (like Taylor)
- Needs volume (100-500 pieces) but with curation
- Desktop preference for purchasing (large transactions)
- Established relationships with suppliers

**Why This Persona Matters:**
This could be the unlock for the 70% market opportunity. Riley needs:
- Volume (more than Taylor's hand-picking)
- Curation (more than Jordan's bulk menswear)
- Women's wear focus
- Business continuity (like Jordan)

## Use Scenarios (Pragmatic Format)

| Persona | Goal | Problem | Frequency |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| Riley | Source curated women's wear in volume | Platform focused on bulk menswear, women's wear limited | Weekly |
| Riley | Maintain consistent shop aesthetic | Can't filter effectively for style/era (Y2K, boho, etc.) | Per sourcing session |
| Riley | Purchase 100-500 curated pieces | Too small for Jordan's 10k orders, too large for Taylor's hand-picking | Weekly |
| Riley | Build supplier relationships in women's wear | Don't know which suppliers specialize in women's premium brands | Ongoing |

## Jobs-to-be-Done

**Primary:**
- "When I need to restock my women's boutique, I want to source 100-500 curated pieces efficiently, so I maintain consistent aesthetic without hand-picking every item."

**Secondary:**
- "When browsing suppliers, I want to know who specializes in women's wear, so I don't waste time on menswear suppliers."
- "When purchasing in volume, I want more curation than bulk but more efficiency than hand-picking, so I balance time and quality."

## Goals

- Maintain women's boutique aesthetic
- Source volume efficiently (100-500 pieces)
- Build supplier relationships in women's wear category
- Compete with online-only curators (like Taylor on Depop)

## Frustrations

- **Platform optimized for menswear:** Bulk buyers get menswear, curators not served at scale
- **Women's wear underserved:** Only 20-30% of platform revenue
- **No middle ground:** Either bulk (10k items) or hand-pick (individual pieces), no curated volume option
- **Supplier specialization unclear:** Don't know who focuses on women's wear

## Evidence

### ✅ Validated (Market Opportunity)
- "Women's market is 70% of fashion revenue but only 20-30% of Fleek revenue" (Hannah)
- Gap between market size and Fleek's capture suggests underserved segment
- Fleek Sort (end March) enables this better by showing individual items within bundles

### ⚠️ To Validate
- Does Riley persona exist in current user base?
- Or is this purely acquisition gap (they don't know about Fleek)?
- Would Riley activate if women's wear inventory and curation tools existed?
- What % of women's wear buyers are Riley vs Taylor?

### 🔮 Future Opportunity
**When unlocked:** Post-Fleek Sort rollout (end March 2026)
**Product needs:** 
- Women's wear category expansion
- Curated bundles (100-500 items with aesthetic coherence)
- Supplier specialization visibility
- Style/era filtering

**Business Impact:** Could unlock 50%+ revenue growth by capturing 70% fashion market share

## Product Implications (Future)

| Insight | Design Implication |
|---------|-------------------|
| Needs volume + curation | "Curated bundles" - 100-500 items with aesthetic coherence |
| Women's wear focus | Category expansion, supplier specialization |
| Desktop preference | Same as Jordan - web experience investment |
| Supplier relationships | Who specializes in women's premium brands (not menswear) |

## For Case Study

**Riley is OUT OF SCOPE but important context:**
- Represents 70% market opportunity
- Not an activation problem (product-market-fit gap)
- Mention as "future unlock" after Fleek Sort enables better women's wear experience
- Shows strategic thinking: solve Casey activation now, unlock Riley market later

---

# Anti-Persona: Casual Consumer

**Who:** Individual consumers buying clothes for personal use (not resale)  
**Why Not:** Fleek is B2B wholesale (bulk/bundles), not B2C retail (individual items for personal wear)  
**Risk if We Target Them:** 
- Dilutes platform for core reseller/retailer audience
- Wrong pricing (wholesale, not retail)
- Wrong packaging (bundles of 50-500 items, not single pieces)
- Wrong messaging (business language, not consumer)

---

# Activation Problem - Root Causes (Casey Focus)

## Current Understanding

**The Problem (From Leadership):**
- "Strong acquisition but weak activation/retention"
- **"New users, particularly those new to reselling entirely,"** find it overwhelming (Hannah)
- "Onboarding launched with slight lift but nothing meaningful"
- "Pouring water into a leaky bucket"

**Who Has the Problem:**
- **Primary:** Casey (new resellers) - confirmed activation struggle
- **Secondary:** Possibly Jordan (if desktop experience blocks activation)
- **Out of Scope:** Taylor (women's wear) - not an activation problem, it's a product-market-fit gap (platform not built for hand-picking yet)

**User feedback themes (see [`fleek-user-feedback-mapping.md`](./fleek-user-feedback-mapping.md)):**

1. **Trust & Legitimacy** - Platform looks like scam, bad reviews visible, QC not transparent
2. **Financial Risk** - Bundle minimums may exceed budgets (£400-500 vs £200)
3. **Product Uncertainty** - Example photos misleading, bundle contents unclear
4. **Supplier Rating Opacity** - Can't understand what drives ratings
5. **Search/Browse Friction** - Browse-first vs search-first UI mismatch

## Critical Unknowns (Need Data to Answer)

**Persona Validation:**
1. What % of signups match Casey vs Jordan vs Taylor/Riley profile?
2. Which persona has the activation problem? (Hypothesis: primarily Casey)
3. Do Taylor/Riley personas exist in user base, or is it acquisition gap?

**Funnel Diagnosis:**
4. Where do users drop off? (Signup → Onboarding → Browse → Cart → Checkout)
5. What % complete each stage?
6. Does drop-off point vary by persona?

**Root Cause Validation:**
7. Are users priced out? (What % view only expensive bundles then drop?)
8. Is trust the blocker? (Do users who view reviews convert less?)
9. Does personalization work? (Do users who complete it convert more?)
10. Is it desktop vs mobile? (Does platform preference matter?)

**Opportunity Sizing:**
11. If we improve activation by 20-30%, what's revenue impact?
12. Which persona improvements have highest ROI?

## Next Steps for Case Study

1. **Data Analysis (24 hours before interview):**
   - Segment users by behavior (Casey/Jordan/Taylor indicators)
   - Map funnel drop-offs
   - Validate which persona has activation problem
   - Prioritize root causes by impact

2. **Solution Design (Live interview):**
   - Address top 2-3 blockers validated by data
   - Show experiment-driven approach
   - 6-week roadmap with 2 engineers
   - Leverage Fleek Sort opportunity (March timing)

3. **Success Metrics:**
   - Define activation (7-day? 30-day? first purchase?)
   - Set baselines and targets
   - Track retention (not just activation)
