## Context

**Fleek's 3 Core Customer Segments (From Website):**

Fleek explicitly defines 3 buyer segments on their website:

### 1. "Start reselling vintage on Fleek"
*"Finding your first supplier is often the hardest part of reselling. Fleek makes it easier with access to 1,000+ verified vintage suppliers. Start small with beginner-friendly bundles, test what sells, and grow at your own pace."*

**Key features:**
- Small minimum order quantities (10-20 pieces) to reduce risk
- Verified suppliers with ratings and reviews
- Buyer protection included on every order

### 2. "Scale your reselling business"
*"Scaling is tough when supply is unreliable. Fleek helps full-time resellers grow with consistent bulk stock and advanced sourcing tools so you can focus on building your shop."*

**Key features:**
- Source high-demand categories (Levi's 501s, Y2K, branded sportswear)
- Place larger orders for better pricing using Demand Hub
- Curate bundles with suppliers via live video calls and moodboards with Virtual Handpick
- Build stronger supplier relationships to improve pricing and margins over time

### 3. "Wholesale vintage stock for shops & online stores"
*"Fleek makes sourcing reliable vintage supply simple for retailers and multi-channel businesses. Connect with 1,000+ verified suppliers, plan seasonal drops with Demand Hub, and handpick bundles that match your shop's aesthetic."*

**Key features:**
- Source wholesale vintage clothing that fits your shop, with transparent grading and representative photos
- Use Demand Hub to secure consistent stock aligned to your store calendar
- Handpick with suppliers to curate inventory and strengthen long-term partnerships

## The Activation Problem

**From Hannah (PM):**
- "New users, particularly those new to reselling entirely, find it overwhelming and don't know where to start"
- Onboarding launched with "slight lift but nothing meaningful"
- "Strong acquisition but weak activation/retention"

**The Challenge:** Segment 1 (Beginner Resellers) are being acquired but not converting to first purchase.

**Platform Optimization Gap (Hannah):**
> "We've only really been able to cater to one [buying style], which is our kind of bulk menswear, like brand purchase journeys... A lot of our women's web buyers are very curated in the way that they purchase. They are very kind of aesthetic and style driven."

**Current State:**
- **Works well for:** Segment 2 (Scale) - bulk menswear buyers
- **Activation problem:** Segment 1 (Beginner) - find it overwhelming
- **Underserved opportunity:** Women's wear buyers with curated aesthetic focus - only 20-30% of revenue vs 70% market opportunity

# Persona 1: Beginner Reseller

**Fleek Segment:** "Start reselling vintage on Fleek"  
**Role:** New to vintage reselling, testing viability  
**Segment:** 16-25 years old, UK/Europe-based  
**Budget:** £200-500 first purchase  
**Experience Level:** New to reselling entirely  
**Status:** 🔴 ACTIVATION PROBLEM - Case study focus

## Overview

**From Fleek's website:** "Finding your first supplier is often the hardest part of reselling. Fleek makes it easier with access to 1,000+ verified vintage suppliers. Start small with beginner-friendly bundles, test what sells, and grow at your own pace."

New to vintage reselling, wants to start side hustle (Vinted, Depop, eBay, local markets). No wholesale experience. Limited budget. Testing if reselling is viable before committing more money.

**Hannah's insight:** "New users, particularly those new to reselling entirely, find it overwhelming and don't know where to start."

**Behavioral traits:**
- Risk-averse (small budget, first-time buyer)
- Browse-first (doesn't know what to search for)
- Trust-sensitive (needs ratings, reviews, buyer protection)
- Mobile-first
- Wants small MOQs (10-20 pieces)

## Use Scenarios

| Goal | Problem | Frequency |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Find first supplier | Overwhelming choice, don't know where to start | First-time |
| Test what sells | Don't know which categories/brands work | First 1-3 purchases |
| Minimize risk | Limited budget (£200-500), can't afford mistakes | Every purchase |
| Build confidence | Need proof platform is legitimate, not scam | Before first purchase |

## Jobs-to-be-Done

**Primary:**
- "When I want to start reselling vintage, I want to find a trustworthy first supplier with small MOQs, so I can test if this business works without risking too much money."

**Secondary:**
- "When browsing suppliers, I want to see ratings and reviews, so I know they're legitimate."
- "When choosing products, I want guidance on what sells, so I don't waste my limited budget."

## Goals

- Start reselling side hustle with minimal risk
- Test viability before committing more money
- Learn what sells before scaling
- Build confidence in platform/suppliers

## Frustrations (From User Feedback)

**Trust & Legitimacy:**
- Platform looks like scam/fake
- Bad reviews visible, no context on ratings
- "Too good to be true" pricing

**Overwhelming Choice:**
- Don't know where to start
- Too many suppliers, categories, options
- No guidance on what sells

**Financial Risk:**
- Bundle minimums may exceed budget (£400-500 vs £200)
- Fear of getting "bad" bundle
- Can't afford mistakes

**Product Uncertainty:**
- Example photos misleading
- Bundle contents unclear
- Don't know what quality to expect

## Behaviors

**Triggers:**  
- Want to start reselling side hustle
- Saw others succeed on Depop/Vinted
- Need extra income

**Current Workflow (Hypothesized):**
1. Download app / land on website
2. Browse (overwhelmed by choice)
3. Try to evaluate suppliers (ratings confusing)
4. Look at bundles (uncertain about contents)
5. **DROP OFF** before first purchase

**Frequency:** One-time (if they don't convert, they churn)

## Evidence

### ✅ Validated
- "New users, particularly those new to reselling entirely, find it overwhelming and don't know where to start" (Hannah)
- Onboarding "slight lift but nothing meaningful"
- Website explicitly targets this segment with "small MOQs (10-20 pieces) to reduce risk"

### ⚠️ To Validate
- What % of signups are beginners vs experienced resellers?
- Where exactly do they drop off in funnel?
- Are they priced out (bundle minimums too high)?
- Is trust the main blocker?
- Do they even find the 10-20 piece bundles, or only see large bulk?

## Product Implications

| Insight | Design Implication |
|---------|-------------------|
| Overwhelming choice | Guided first purchase flow, personalized recommendations |
| Trust deficit | Visible buyer protection, rating transparency, social proof |
| Budget constraints | Surface 10-20 piece bundles prominently for beginners |
| Product uncertainty | Better bundle previews, representative photos, quality expectations |
| Don't know what sells | Category guidance, "popular with beginners" tags |

# Persona 4: Women's Boutique Owner - OPPORTUNITY

**Role:** Women's vintage boutique owner (curated aesthetic)  
**Segment:** 30-50 years old, UK/Europe/US-based  
**Budget:** £2,000-8,000/month  
**Experience Level:** Established business  
**Status:** 🔮 UNDERSERVED OPPORTUNITY - 70% market, 20-30% of Fleek revenue

## Overview

**Hannah's insight:** "Women's market is 70% of fashion revenue but only 20-30% of Fleek revenue... Women's wear buyers are very curated in the way that they purchase. They are very kind of aesthetic and style driven... We've only really been able to cater to bulk menswear buyers."

Owns women's vintage boutique (physical shop or online) with strong aesthetic identity (Y2K, boho, cottagecore, etc.). Needs wholesale volumes but with HIGH curation focus - much more selective than general wholesale. Platform currently optimized for bulk menswear, not curated women's wear.

**The Gap:**
- Platform serves bulk menswear well (Segment 2 & 3)
- Women's wear buyers need curation + volume + aesthetic coherence
- Only 20-30% of revenue despite 70% market opportunity

**Behavioral traits:**
- Highly aesthetic-driven (brand identity critical)
- Women's wear focus (not menswear)
- Curation at volume (100-500 pieces, but very selective)
- Desktop preference (large purchases)
- Visual discovery (browse by style, era, aesthetic)

## Use Scenarios

| Goal | Problem | Frequency |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Source curated women's wear | Platform focused on bulk menswear | Weekly/monthly |
| Maintain boutique aesthetic | Can't filter by style/era effectively | Every purchase |
| Purchase 100-500 curated pieces | Either too bulk (random) or too small (hand-pick) | Per seasonal cycle |
| Find women's wear specialists | Don't know which suppliers specialize in women's premium brands | Ongoing |

## Jobs-to-be-Done

**Primary:**
- "When I need to restock my women's boutique, I want to source 100-500 curated pieces that match my shop's aesthetic (Y2K, boho, etc.), so I maintain brand consistency without hand-picking every single item."

**Secondary:**
- "When browsing suppliers, I want to know who specializes in women's wear with specific aesthetics, so I don't waste time on menswear or irrelevant suppliers."
- "When purchasing, I want more curation than bulk but more efficiency than hand-picking individual pieces, so I balance time and quality."

## Goals

- Maintain strong boutique aesthetic identity
- Source women's wear in volume (100-500 pieces)
- Find suppliers who understand curated women's wear
- Differentiate from fast fashion and bulk resellers

## Frustrations

- **Platform optimized for menswear:** Bulk buyers get menswear (Levi's, Nike, etc.), not women's premium brands
- **Women's wear underserved:** Only 20-30% of platform revenue
- **Curation gap:** Either bulk (random) or hand-pick (too time-consuming), no middle ground
- **Aesthetic filtering:** Can't effectively browse by style/era (Y2K, boho, cottagecore)
- **Supplier specialization:** Don't know who focuses on women's wear

## Evidence

### ✅ Validated (Market Opportunity)
- "Women's market is 70% of fashion revenue but only 20-30% of Fleek revenue" (Hannah)
- "Women's wear buyers are very curated... want 100 pieces they've specifically chosen themselves... very aesthetic and style driven" (Hannah)
- "We've only been able to cater to bulk menswear buyers" (Hannah)
- Gap between market size (70%) and Fleek capture (20-30%) = underserved

### ⚠️ To Validate
- Do these buyers exist in current user base?
- Are they dropping off during activation?
- Or is this acquisition gap (they don't know about Fleek)?
- Would they activate if women's wear inventory and curation tools existed?
- What % of women's wear buyers fit this profile vs Persona 2 (Scale)?

### 🔮 Future Opportunity
**When unlocked:** Post-Fleek Sort rollout (end March 2026) enables better curation
**Product needs:** 
- Women's wear category expansion (supplier recruitment)
- Aesthetic/style filtering (Y2K, boho, cottagecore, etc.)
- Curated bundles (100-500 pieces with aesthetic coherence)
- Supplier specialization visibility (who focuses on women's premium)

**Business Impact:** Could unlock 50%+ revenue growth by capturing 70% fashion market share

## Product Implications (Future)

| Insight | Design Implication |
|---------|-------------------|
| Aesthetic-driven curation | Style/era filtering, visual browse (Y2K, boho, etc.) |
| Women's wear focus | Supplier specialization tags, category expansion |
| Curation at volume | "Curated bundles" - 100-500 pieces with aesthetic coherence |
| Premium women's brands | Supplier recruitment for women's wear specialists |

## For Case Study

**This persona is OUT OF SCOPE but important strategic context:**
- Represents 70% market opportunity
- NOT an activation problem (product-market-fit gap - platform not built for them yet)
- Mention as "future unlock" after Fleek Sort and women's wear expansion
- Shows strategic thinking: solve Persona 1 activation now, unlock Persona 4 market later

# Activation Problem - Root Causes (Persona 1 Focus)

## Current Understanding

**The Problem (From Leadership):**
- "New users, particularly those new to reselling entirely, find it overwhelming and don't know where to start" (Hannah)
- Onboarding "slight lift but nothing meaningful"
- "Strong acquisition but weak activation/retention"
- "Pouring water into a leaky bucket"

**Who Has the Problem:**
- **Primary:** Persona 1 (Beginner Resellers) - confirmed activation struggle
- **Working Well:** Persona 2 (Scale), Persona 3 (Wholesale) - platform built for them
- **Out of Scope:** Persona 4 (Women's Boutique) - not activation problem, it's product-market-fit gap

**User feedback themes (see [`fleek-user-feedback-mapping.md`](./fleek-user-feedback-mapping.md)):**

1. **Trust & Legitimacy** - Platform looks like scam, bad reviews visible, QC not transparent
2. **Financial Risk** - Bundle minimums may exceed budgets (£400-500 vs £200-500)
3. **Product Uncertainty** - Example photos misleading, bundle contents unclear
4. **Supplier Rating Opacity** - Can't understand what drives ratings
5. **Search/Browse Friction** - Browse-first users (Persona 1) vs search-first UI

## Critical Unknowns (Need Data to Answer)

**Persona Validation:**
1. What % of signups match Persona 1 vs 2 vs 3?
2. Does Persona 1 have significantly worse activation than Persona 2/3?
3. At what budget level do users successfully activate?

**Funnel Diagnosis:**
4. Where does Persona 1 drop off? (Signup → Browse → Supplier Page → Bundle Page → Cart → Checkout)
5. What % complete each stage?
6. Do they even find the 10-20 piece bundles mentioned on website?

**Root Cause Validation:**
7. Are they priced out? (Do they only see £400+ bundles when budget is £200-500?)
8. Is trust the blocker? (Do users who view reviews/ratings convert less?)
9. Is it overwhelming choice? (Do users browse but never click into suppliers?)
10. Does personalization help? (Do users who complete onboarding convert more?)

**Opportunity Sizing:**
11. If we improve Persona 1 activation by 20-30%, what's revenue impact?
12. What % of signups are Persona 1 vs 2/3? (Prioritization decision)

## Next Steps for Case Study

1. **Data Analysis (24 hours before interview):**
   - Segment users by persona indicators (budget, behavior, order size)
   - Map Persona 1 funnel drop-offs
   - Validate root causes (pricing, trust, overwhelming)
   - Compare Persona 1 vs 2/3 activation rates

2. **Case Study Presentation:**
   - Focus on Persona 1 activation problem
   - Use Persona 2/3 as "what good looks like"
   - Mention Persona 4 as strategic opportunity (out of scope)
   - Data-driven prioritization of solutions
