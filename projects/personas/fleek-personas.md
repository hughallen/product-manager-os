# Fleek Buyer Personas

**Data Sources:** 
- Leadership interviews: Hannah (PM), Sanket (Founder)
- User interview transcripts (qualitative feedback - 5 themes, 13+ quotes)
- Case study brief
- Competitive analysis (Depop, Vinted, Grailed, Etsy, eBay)

**Generated:** February 16, 2026  
**Updates existing:** No - created from scratch for case study

---

## Context

**What I found in project files:**
- **Existing personas:** None - creating from scratch
- **Product context:** Fleek - B2B vintage wholesale marketplace (joinfleek.com)
- **Target market:** Resellers and retailers (UK, Europe, US) sourcing from suppliers in Pakistan/India/Dubai
- **Activation challenge:** Strong acquisition, weak activation/retention

**Product Overview:**
- Two-sided marketplace: Buyers (resellers/retailers) ↔ Suppliers (Pakistan/India/Dubai)
- B2B focus (wholesale bundles, not individual consumers)
- Supply chain innovation: Western donations → East processing → global resale
- AI transformation: Fleek Sort (automated grading, 100% inventory online by end March)
- Revenue model: Commission on transactions, comes from retention not acquisition

**The Problem:**
New users (particularly new resellers) find platform "overwhelming and don't know where to start." Onboarding launched with "slight lift but nothing meaningful." Need to activate the right users who will retain.

# Persona 1: New Reseller (Casey)

**Role:** First-time reseller / Side hustler  
**Segment:** Gen Z (16-18 years old), UK/Europe-based  
**Budget:** £200 (pocket money/savings)  
**Experience Level:** Beginner - new to wholesale  
**Persona Type:** Buyer + User (they buy and use the platform)

## Overview

Casey is a Gen Z entrepreneur wanting to start a reselling business on Depop/Vinted. They've sold personal items before but never purchased wholesale. Fleek lowers barriers, but Casey gets overwhelmed and abandons before first purchase. Digital-native (mobile-first) but new to B2B platforms and wholesale pricing.

**Behavioral traits:**
- Browse-first (doesn't know what to search for)
- Risk-averse (£200 budget = no mistakes)
- Needs validation (platform looks "like a scam")
- Price-sensitive (£400-500 bundles exceed budget)

## Use Scenarios (Pragmatic Format)

| Persona | Goal | Problem | Frequency |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| Casey | Find first bundle to purchase | Too many options, don't know what will resell, platform overwhelming | First visit (make-or-break) |
| Casey | Assess if bundle is profitable | Can't see contents clearly, don't know quality, example photos misleading | Every bundle view |
| Casey | Trust Fleek is legitimate | Platform "screams red flag," bad reviews at top, no visible QC, too good to be true | Pre-purchase (blocks conversion) |
| Casey | Purchase first bundle with confidence | Minimums (£400-500) exceed budget (£200), can't test with small order | Once (if affordable) |
| Casey | Understand supplier ratings | Can't figure out what caused low scores, would buy if knew it was just slow shipping | Supplier evaluation |

## Jobs-to-be-Done

**Primary:**
- "When I want to start a reselling business, I want to source quality vintage inventory affordably, so I can make money without traveling to Pakistan."

**Secondary:**
- "When I'm new to wholesale, I want to understand what to buy and how much to spend, so I don't waste my savings."
- "When I'm evaluating inventory, I want to know exactly what's in the bundle, so I can assess if items will sell on Depop."
- "When I'm skeptical of Fleek, I want to see proof it's legitimate, so I can trust the platform with my money."
- "When I can't afford large bundles, I want smaller starter options (£50-100), so I can test before committing."

## Goals

- Start generating income from reselling
- Learn how to source profitable inventory
- Build confidence in buying decisions with limited budget
- Grow from side hustle to sustainable business
- Avoid mistakes (can't afford them)

## Frustrations

**Trust & Legitimacy:**
- Platform looks like a scam at first glance
- Negative reviews surfaced prominently
- Quality control not visible/transparent
- Prices seem "too good to be true" (don't understand wholesale economics)
- Need human validation before trusting

**Financial Risk:**
- Bundle minimums (£400-500) exceed budget (£200)
- Can't afford to test platform with small order
- Mistakes are catastrophic with limited savings
- Want £50-100 "starter bundles" to de-risk

**Product Uncertainty:**
- Example photos misleading (same photo on multiple listings)
- Don't know bundle contents (sizes, brands, materials, quantity)
- Can't assess if items will sell on Depop
- Expectation mismatches (advertised brands don't arrive)

**Overwhelming Experience:**
- Too many options, don't know where to start
- No guidance on what to buy
- Personalization doesn't seem to work (homepage still generic)
- Don't know what to search for (browse-first behavior)

**Rating Opacity:**
- Can't understand what drives supplier ratings
- Would buy from low-rated if knew it was just slow shipping (not quality)
- Lack of transparency blocks decision-making

## Behaviors

**Triggers:**  
- Sees others selling vintage on Depop/Instagram
- Wants side income / entrepreneurship
- Finds Fleek through social media/word of mouth

**Workflow:**
1. Signup (mobile-first)
2. Onboarding (completes personalization but no reward)
3. Homepage (feels generic/overwhelming despite personalization)
4. Browse bundles (confused by example photos, prices)
5. View supplier page (sees bad reviews at top)
6. **Abandons** (overwhelmed + trust barrier + priced out)

**Frequency:** First visit only - drops off before first purchase (activation problem)

## Evidence

### ✅ Validated (Leadership Interviews)
- "New users, particularly those new to reselling entirely, face difficulties getting going on Fleek. They find it overwhelming and don't know where to start." (Case study brief)
- "We've launched onboarding which has driven a slight lift but nothing meaningful." (Case study brief)
- "Fleek is actively expanding the market... people come in, they say, 'I started reselling because I could buy a bundle.'" (Sanket)

### ✅ Validated (User Research - High Confidence)
**Financial constraints:**
> "A lot of the higher priced things are out of my price range because they're such big bundles... if they had smaller bottles which were cheaper, I'd be thinking, all right, okay, I can pick them up… £400-500... not something I can do at the minute."

**Browse-first behavior:**
> "I don't go on the app knowing what I'm looking for. So when I go on there, I don't know what I'm searching for… so the search to me there's nothing for me to put in."

**Mentions "newer buyers" explicitly:**
> "For newer buyers, that would be an issue if they expect a bunch of branded jeans and they get one branded jeans instead of five."

### ✅ Validated (User Research - Likely Casey)
**Trust/scam anxiety:**
> "It seemed like such a scam to me like just the way it like presented itself… it just screams like red flag to me."

> "It kind of sounded too good to be true… I didn't want to get catfished. It wasn't until I spoke to someone physically that I had the trust to do it."

**Product uncertainty:**
> "I weren't sure 100%… is the listing I've selected is that just generic and I won't receive the actual items in the photograph."

**Small test orders:**
> "I don't start with an order of 500 that's just too risky. …When I find a new supplier I would like to try I do a small order of €50 so I can see how does it arrive."

### ⚠️ To Validate with Data
- What % of signups match Casey profile? (budget indicators, browse behavior)
- What % are priced out by £400-500 minimums?
- Does Casey have activation problem or is it Jordan/Taylor?
- Where exactly do Casey-like users drop off in funnel?

## Product Implications

| Insight | Design Implication |
|---------|-------------------|
| Browse-first, don't know what to search | Homepage with curated "Popular with new resellers," category cards, not search-first UI |
| £200 budget, £400-500 minimums | Starter bundles (£50-100) or surface affordable options prominently |
| Platform looks like scam | Professional design quality, visible buyer protection, quality control transparency |
| Bad reviews at top | Adjust review relevance algorithm, don't surface all bad reviews first |
| Example photos misleading | Leverage Fleek Sort (3 images/item) for bundle transparency, clear "example" labeling |
| No personalization feedback | Show "Based on your preferences" section immediately after onboarding |
| Rating opacity | Break down ratings: delivery, quality, communication - enable risk assessment |
| Overwhelming experience | Progressive disclosure, curated entry points, guided first purchase |

## Quotes (Representative)

> "It seemed like such a scam to me like just the way it like presented itself… it just screams like red flag to me."

> "A lot of the higher priced things are out of my price range... £400-500... if they had smaller bottles which were cheaper, I'd be thinking, all right, okay, I can pick them up."

> "I don't go on the app knowing what I'm looking for... I don't know what I'm searching for."

> "It kind of sounded too good to be true… I didn't want to get catfished. It wasn't until I spoke to someone physically that I had the trust to do it."

# Persona 2: Large Retailer (Jordan)

**Role:** Brick-and-mortar vintage shop owner / Large reseller  
**Segment:** 40-60+ years old, UK/Europe/US-based  
**Budget:** £10,000-30,000/month  
**Experience Level:** Expert - established business  
**Persona Type:** Buyer + User (buys and uses for business)

## Overview

Jordan owns an established vintage clothing shop (e.g., Brooklyn vintage store) and needs continuous, reliable inventory. Used to travel to Pakistan/Dubai quarterly to source - now uses Fleek for digital sourcing. High-value customer (£10-30k/month) who generates most revenue once activated. Prefers desktop for large transactions, not super tech-savvy.

**Behavioral traits:**
- Search-first (knows specific brands/categories)
- Business operator (needs continuity and reliability)
- Desktop preference (£3-5k transactions on laptop)
- High retention once activated (where Fleek makes money)

## Use Scenarios (Pragmatic Format)

| Persona | Goal | Problem | Frequency |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| Jordan | Restock shop with bulk inventory | Web experience poor, forced to app, but prefers laptop for large spends | Weekly |
| Jordan | Place £3-5k order with confidence | Limited product views on web, can't inspect at scale | Weekly |
| Jordan | Track order status and delivery | No tracking visibility, blind spot in supply chain | Per order (ongoing anxiety) |
| Jordan | Find specific items (brand/category) | Search not effective enough, results not relevant | Daily browsing |
| Jordan | Build reliable supplier relationships | Want repeat suppliers, priority access, consistent quality | Ongoing (business continuity) |
| Jordan | Understand supplier reliability | Rating system confusing, can't assess delivery vs quality vs communication | Supplier evaluation |

## Jobs-to-be-Done

**Primary:**
- "When I need to restock my shop, I want to source bulk inventory quickly and reliably, so I maintain continuous sales without travel."

**Secondary:**
- "When I'm spending £3-5k on a transaction, I want to browse on my laptop with detailed views, so I can make confident large purchases."
- "When I find a good supplier, I want to build a relationship and get priority access, so I have consistent quality supply."
- "When I need specific items (10,000 Lululemon leggings), I want to communicate my needs, so suppliers can fulfill custom requests."
- "When my order is in transit, I want to track it, so I can plan inventory management and customer commitments."

## Goals

- Maintain continuous inventory flow (business continuity)
- Source quality items at profitable margins
- Build reliable supplier relationships
- Scale business without travel overhead (used to go to Pakistan quarterly)
- Minimize risk with large purchases

## Frustrations

**Web Platform:**
- Platform pushes to app, but prefers laptop for £3-5k transactions
- Desktop experience poor, not optimized for large transactions
- Big spenders (like Jordan) get worse experience

**Operational:**
- Lack of order tracking (can't see delivery status)
- Search limitations (doesn't surface right inventory)
- No supplier relationship tools (want repeat suppliers, priority access)

**Trust & Transparency:**
- Rating system confusing (same as Casey, but different stakes)
- Product uncertainty (even at scale, wants bundle clarity)
- Quality expectations not set upfront

## Behaviors

**Triggers:**
- Regular inventory restocking needs (business operations)
- Seasonal demand (need specific categories)
- Supplier relationship development

**Workflow:**
1. Desktop browse (weekly)
2. Search specific brands/categories
3. Evaluate suppliers (ratings, past purchases)
4. Message suppliers for custom requests
5. Place large order (£3-5k)
6. **Returns weekly** (high retention)

**Frequency:** Weekly active, monthly large purchases

## Evidence

### ✅ Validated (Leadership Interviews)
- "Big spenders (£3-5k transactions) prefer laptop browsing. Older demographics (40-60+ shop owners) less mobile-native." (Hannah)
- "Some of our retailers are buying 10,000 pairs of Lululemon leggings in one go." (Hannah)
- "Used to require travel to Pakistan/Dubai - now digital" (Sanket)
- "Revenue comes from retention" - high LTV customers (Sanket)

### ✅ Validated (User Research - High Confidence)
**Desktop preference:**
> "I think on desktop it's not the best. I think it definitely needs improved... But fleek's kind of one that always pops up because it's so easy to kind of find what you're looking for."

### ✅ Validated (Universal - Affects Jordan Too)
**Rating confusion:**
> "In terms of understanding the star rating, I don't know... It's hard to differentiate between like a mediocre order and a very good order."

### ⚠️ To Validate with Data
- Does Jordan have activation problem or retention problem?
- What % of signups match Jordan profile?
- Is web experience blocking activation or just hurting retention?

## Product Implications

| Insight | Design Implication |
|---------|-------------------|
| Desktop preference for large spends | Invest in web experience, don't force to app |
| Search-first behavior | Optimize search for brands/categories, not just browse |
| Need supplier relationships | Supplier following, repeat supplier tools, priority access |
| Order tracking blind spot | Post-purchase visibility, delivery tracking |
| High LTV once activated | Retention focus, not just activation |
| Rating opacity (universal) | Rating breakdown affects all personas - fix it |

## Quotes

> "Big spenders (£3-5k transactions) prefer laptop browsing. Older demographics (40-60+ shop owners) less mobile-native." — Hannah

> "I think on desktop it's not the best. I think it definitely needs improved."

# Persona 3: Women's Wear Curator (Taylor)

**Role:** Curated vintage reseller (Depop, Instagram-based)  
**Segment:** 25-35 years old, UK/Europe-based  
**Budget:** £500-2,000/month  
**Experience Level:** Intermediate - established aesthetic/brand  
**Persona Type:** Buyer + User

## Overview

Taylor sells curated vintage on Depop/Instagram with a specific aesthetic (Y2K, cottagecore, etc.). Not interested in bulk menswear bundles - wants to hand-pick individual pieces. Fleek Sort (100% inventory online by end March) unlocks this use case, but experience not optimized yet.

**Behavioral traits:**
- Aesthetic-driven (brand consistency matters)
- Hand-pick focus (not bulk)
- Visual discovery (browse by style, not search)
- Medium budget (£500-2k/month)

## Use Scenarios (Pragmatic Format)

| Persona | Goal | Problem | Frequency |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| Taylor | Hand-pick pieces matching aesthetic | Platform optimized for bulk, not individual selection | Weekly sourcing |
| Taylor | Browse women's wear inventory | Women's wear underserved (70% of market, 20-30% of Fleek) | Daily browsing |
| Taylor | Build custom bundle of curated pieces | Can't select individual items, forced into bulk bundles | Per sourcing session |
| Taylor | Ensure authenticity for resale | Fear of fakes, need QC for Depop credibility | Every purchase |

## Jobs-to-be-Done

**Primary:**
- "When I need inventory for my curated shop, I want to hand-pick individual pieces that match my aesthetic, so my brand stays consistent."

**Secondary:**
- "When browsing inventory, I want to see detailed photos and item details, so I can assess fit with my aesthetic."
- "When I find pieces I love, I want to purchase them individually or build custom bundles, so I'm not stuck with unwanted items."

## Goals

- Maintain consistent brand aesthetic
- Source unique, standout pieces
- Build custom collections
- Differentiate from bulk resellers

## Frustrations

- Platform optimized for bulk menswear, not curated women's wear
- Can't hand-pick effectively (current experience doesn't support it)
- Women's wear underserved (70% of fashion revenue, 20-30% of Fleek revenue)

## Evidence

### ✅ Validated (Leadership Interviews)
- "Women's market is 70% of fashion revenue but only 20-30% of Fleek revenue" (Hannah)
- "Women's wear buyers are very curated... want 100 pieces they've specifically chosen themselves... very aesthetic and style driven" (Hannah)
- "We've only been able to cater to bulk menswear buyers" (Hannah)
- Fleek Sort enables individual piece purchasing with 3 images per item

### ⚠️ To Validate
- What % of signups match Taylor profile?
- Does Fleek Sort rollout (end March) unlock Taylor activation?
- Is Taylor activation problem or acquisition problem?

## Product Implications

| Insight | Design Implication |
|---------|-------------------|
| Hand-pick focus | Individual item selection powered by Fleek Sort |
| Visual discovery | Browse by aesthetic/style, not just brand/category |
| Women's wear gap | 70% market opportunity, needs focus |
| Curated bundles | Custom bundle builder, not fixed bundles |

---

# Anti-Persona: Casual Consumer

**Who:** Individual consumers buying clothes for personal use (not resale)  
**Why Not:** Fleek is B2B wholesale (bulk/bundles), not B2C retail (individual items for personal wear)  
**Risk if We Target Them:** 
- Dilutes platform for core reseller/retailer audience
- Wrong pricing (wholesale, not retail)
- Wrong packaging (bundles of 50-500 items, not single pieces)
- Wrong messaging (business language, not consumer)

---

# Persona Comparison

| Attribute | Casey (New Reseller) | Jordan (Large Retailer) | Taylor (Women's Curator) |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Segment** | Gen Z, 16-18 | Established, 40-60+ | Millennial, 25-35 |
| **Budget** | £200 | £10-30k/month | £500-2k/month |
| **Primary goal** | Start reselling business | Continuous inventory supply | Curated aesthetic inventory |
| **Key pain** | Overwhelming + trust + priced out | Poor web experience | Can't hand-pick effectively |
| **Behavior** | Browse-first, mobile | Search-first, desktop | Visual discovery, mobile/web |
| **Purchase frequency** | Once (if converts) | Weekly | Weekly |
| **Activation challenge** | **HIGH** (case study focus) | Low (activates, retains well) | Medium (needs Fleek Sort) |
| **LTV** | Low-Medium (if they grow) | **Very High** (£10-30k/month) | Medium (£500-2k/month) |
| **Revenue timing** | Future (if activate + retain) | **Now** (already high-value) | Opportunity (70% market) |

# Activation Problem - Root Causes (Hypothesized, To Validate)

## Current Understanding

**From leadership:**
- "Strong acquisition but weak activation/retention"
- "New users find it overwhelming and don't know where to start"
- "Onboarding launched with slight lift but nothing meaningful"
- "Pouring water into a leaky bucket"

**User feedback themes (see [`fleek-user-feedback-mapping.md`](./fleek-user-feedback-mapping.md)):**

1. **Trust & Legitimacy** - Platform looks like scam, bad reviews visible, QC not transparent
2. **Financial Risk** - Bundle minimums may exceed budgets (£400-500 vs £200)
3. **Product Uncertainty** - Example photos misleading, bundle contents unclear
4. **Supplier Rating Opacity** - Can't understand what drives ratings
5. **Search/Browse Friction** - Browse-first vs search-first UI mismatch

## Critical Unknowns (Need Data to Answer)

**Persona Validation:**
1. What % of signups match Casey vs Jordan vs Taylor profile?
2. Which persona has the activation problem?
3. Is it one persona or all personas?

**Funnel Diagnosis:**
4. Where do users drop off? (Signup → Onboarding → Browse → Cart → Checkout)
5. What % complete each stage?
6. Does drop-off point vary by persona?

**Root Cause Validation:**
7. Are users priced out? (What % view only expensive bundles then drop?)
8. Is trust the blocker? (Do users who view reviews convert less?)
9. Does personalization work? (Do users who complete it convert more?)
10. Is it desktop vs mobile? (Does platform preference matter?)

**Opportunity Sizing:**
11. If we improve activation by 20-30%, what's revenue impact?
12. Which persona improvements have highest ROI?

## Next Steps for Case Study

1. **Data Analysis (24 hours before interview):**
   - Segment users by behavior (Casey/Jordan/Taylor indicators)
   - Map funnel drop-offs
   - Validate which persona has activation problem
   - Prioritize root causes by impact

2. **Solution Design (Live interview):**
   - Address top 2-3 blockers validated by data
   - Show experiment-driven approach
   - 6-week roadmap with 2 engineers
   - Leverage Fleek Sort opportunity (March timing)

3. **Success Metrics:**
   - Define activation (7-day? 30-day? first purchase?)
   - Set baselines and targets
   - Track retention (not just activation)
