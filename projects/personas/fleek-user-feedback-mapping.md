**Persona Indicators:**
- 🆕 = Likely **Casey (New Reseller)** - mentions limited budget, being new, first-time concerns
- 🏪 = Likely **Jordan (Large Retailer)** - mentions established business, larger orders, desktop preference
- 🎨 = Likely **Taylor (Women's Curator)** - mentions curation, aesthetic, specific pieces

## Theme 1: Trust, "Scam" Anxiety, and Legitimacy

### Quote 1.1
**Persona Indicator:** ❓ (Could be any first-time user)

> "It seemed like such a scam to me like just the way it like presented itself… it just screams like red flag to me. I just thought, oh, that's just kind of like, you know, but when you read into it, it's kind of like you obviously it's actually a marketplace."

**Context Clues:**
- First impression of platform
- Initial skepticism but eventual understanding
- No budget or experience level mentioned

**Applies to:**
- Definitely: Casey (new users most susceptible to scam anxiety)
- Possibly: Any first-time user of Fleek

---

### Quote 1.2
**Persona Indicator:** 🆕 (Likely Casey - mentions needing physical person validation)

> "It kind of sounded too good to be true… I didn't want to get catfished. It wasn't until I spoke to someone physically that I had the trust to do it."

**Context Clues:**
- "Too good to be true" suggests unfamiliarity with wholesale pricing
- Needed human validation before purchasing (high trust barrier)
- Risk-averse language

**Applies to:**
- Definitely: Casey (new resellers with high trust barriers)
- Possibly: Taylor (smaller scale, still risk-averse)

---

### Quote 1.3
**Persona Indicator:** 🆕 (Likely Casey - researching reviews before first purchase)

> "I was a bit sketchy at first because I did look at reviews and stuff and the reviews weren't always very positive… I heard a lot of people that they got wrong orders… and they got dirty clothes or fake clothes."

**Context Clues:**
- Reviewing before first purchase (new user behavior)
- Concerned about wrong orders and fakes
- Risk evaluation phase

**Applies to:**
- Definitely: Casey (new users in research phase)
- Possibly: Any first-time purchaser

---

### Quote 1.4
**Persona Indicator:** ❓ (Possibly 🆕 or 🎨 - authentication concern suggests curation focus)

> "It's quite scary just knowing that there's so many fakes about and they won't be picked up. …The main selling point for me when I started buying on Fleek was that everything would be authentic and it come out at quality control… but then if it's not going to then that element of trust is definitely removed."

**Context Clues:**
- "When I started buying" suggests established user reflecting on journey
- Authentication important (could be reseller who needs branded items)
- Quality control expectations
- Fear of fakes suggests they resell on platforms where authenticity matters (Depop)

**Applies to:**
- Possibly: Casey (concerned about reselling fakes)

## Theme 2: Confusion Over Rating System

### Quote 2.1
**Persona Indicator:** ❓ (Any user trying to assess supplier risk)

> "I can never really figure out exactly what's caused that score to be low. …Was it delivery time? Don't know. Was it… for any reason… I figure that the score should just I should know why they've got a bad score because at least then if I know what their bad points are, I can try and mitigate it."

---

### Quote 2.3
**Persona Indicator:** ❓ (Any user trying to interpret ratings)

> "In terms of understanding the star rating, I don't know if it I don't I don't really know what it means. …It's hard to differentiate between like a mediocre order and a very good order cuz a mediocre could be perceived as three and then a half decent order could be four even though there's only one number."

**Context Clues:**
- Trying to understand rating scale
- No clear decision framework

- Noticed same photo on multiple listings (observant browsing)
- Questioning basic platform mechanics

**Applies to:**
- Definitely: Casey (first-time users confused by platform model)

---

### Quote 3.2
**Persona Indicator:** ❓ (Any user wanting bundle specifics)

### Quote 3.3
**Persona Indicator:** 🆕 (Likely Casey - mentions "newer buyers" as separate from self, suggests learning phase)

> "They adverted as vintage jeans and then they put a bunch of brands behind them… and then you get four jeans that are unbranded… brands that weren't even in the description… For newer buyers, that would be an issue if they expect a bunch of branded jeans and they get one branded jeans instead of five."

**Context Clues:**
- Post-purchase surprise
- Admits didn't check description thoroughly
- Size ambiguity issue
- No reference/comparison available

**Applies to:**

## Theme 4: Financial Risk for Small Buyers

### Quote 4.1
**Persona Indicator:** 🆕 (Definitely Casey - mentions limited budget, price range concerns)

> "A lot of the higher priced things are out of my price range because they're such big bundles. So maybe… if they had smaller bottles which were cheaper, I'd be thinking, all right, okay, I can pick them up… I think a lot of the more expensive things you're looking 4, 500 and it's not something I can do at the minute."

**Context Clues:**
- £400-500 bundles out of price range

**Applies to:**
- Possibly: Casey (£200 budget, wants £50 test orders)

### Quote 5.1

**Context Clues:**

---

### Quote 5.2
**Persona Indicator:** 🏪 (Likely Jordan - mentions desktop preference)

> "I think on desktop it's not the best. I think it definitely needs improved… there's loads of suppliers in there as well. But fleek's kind of one that always pops up because it's so easy to kind of find what you're looking for."

## Key Insights from Mapping Exercise

### What We Know:
1. **Trust/scam anxiety affects all first-time users** (not persona-specific)
2. **Rating confusion is universal** (affects Casey, Jordan, Taylor equally)
3. **Financial constraints are Casey-specific** (£400-500 bundles price them out)
4. **Desktop preference is Jordan-specific** (large transactions on laptops)
5. **Product uncertainty affects everyone** (but severity/impact varies)

### What We Don't Know (Need Data to Answer):
1. **Which persona is priority for activation?** (Could be Casey, could be both)
2. **What % of users are priced out?** (How big is the Casey £200 budget problem?)
3. **Which pain point has highest impact?** (Trust? Affordability? Transparency?)
4. **Do personas experience same problems differently?** (e.g., Does Casey drop off due to trust, while Taylor drops off due to bundle sizes?)

### Questions for Data Analysis (Case Study):
1. What's the activation rate by user segment?
2. What's the average bundle price users attempt to purchase vs. complete?
3. Where in funnel do users drop off? (Browse → Cart → Checkout)
4. Do desktop users convert differently than mobile?
5. What's the correlation between rating views and purchase completion?

## How to Use This for Case Study

**During Data Analysis (24 hours before):**
- Segment users by order size, frequency, purchase history
- Map drop-off points to persona hypotheses
- Validate which persona(s) have activation problem

**During Live Session:**
- Reference specific quotes when presenting problem
- Show which persona(s) each solution addresses
- Acknowledge what we don't know and how you'd validate

**Key Principle:**
Don't assume personas until data confirms. Design solutions that could address multiple personas where possible.
