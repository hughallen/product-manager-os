Transcript:
 
Me: Hi, Hannah.  
Them: Hugh. How are you?  
Me: Yeah, good. How are you?  
Them: Good. Thank you.  
Me: Been looking forward to this conversation.  
Them: Oh, great. Me too. I'm just telling the air conditioning off because someone seems to have put the AC on, which, if you're in London, which are senior, is not what we need right now.  
Me: Nice. No, definitely not.  
Them: Whereabouts are you? Base.  
Me: In the barbican, so not too far from Hua.  
Them: Oh, nice. I cycled through. I cycled through there just this morning, actually, from.  
Me: Nice. What about you? Are you here in London as well?  
Them: In London? Yes, usually in London. Fields in Hackney, so East London, but living in Surrey a little bit at the moment. My mum's in Surrey, so I'm commuting a bit and just all over at the moment.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Nice. So are you actually living in. In Barbican?  
Me: Yeah, I've been my boyfriend at the beginning of last year.  
Them: Interesting. Nice.  
Me: Yeah, it's cool. It's a cool place to live.  
Them: That's really central. I don't think I know anyone that lives in Barbican.  
Me: Yeah. I mean, it's funny because I actually used to live in Hamerton for ages, for kind of like three or four years. So I've never lived in central London before. But it's cool. I can walk to the theater and just get around more easily, and it's kind of a different vision. Of London. I guess I'm not going to stay here forever, but it's cool to experience for.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, great spot. Great spot. Nice. Well, thank you so much for jumping on and having a chat with me. You've spoken to Sanket already, right?  
Me: Last week.  
Them: Okay, cool. So hopefully he gave you the kind of the founder view of fleek. Usually he tells you a little bit about the like supply chain and what the second hand industry looks like. Okay, cool. Was your mind. I remember when through that.  
Me: Yeah. That's amazing. I don't know. I guess I didn't know what I expected. But, yeah, I guess that kind of level of depth and the kind of attention paid to the supply chain side as well is really interesting. You can kind of unpick the entire flow and see kind of all the way through from warehouse to end customer. I thought that kind of the way I was picturing in my head made it really exciting.  
Them: Yeah. Completely agree. I had my mind blown once I get took me through that during my interview process. I think I've always loved vintage and always shopped secondhand. And considered myself, like, very much part of that world. But for whatever reason, I've never thought about where those clothes come from and what that looks like. So behind the scenes view of it all, I just thought it was the best thing. By that point. But let me give you a bit of an introduction to kind of me and where I sit in the world at Fleek, and then would love to just hear a bit about you and your background and kind of what you're looking for as well. So I'm Hannah, nice to meet you. I look after product primarily on the bio side of the fleet marketplace. So obviously, two sided marketplace. We've got buyers on one side who are in uk, Western Europe, us, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, like all over the west. And then we've got our suppliers who are actually. Primarily based out of Karachi and Pakistan, India and the Middle East. There are big kind of import export zones for secondhand clothes. So operating as a very kind of geographically distributed marketplace, which has its fun and its challenges, but for the most part, I'm looking after the buyer side. And that's split into two areas. One is growth, which is essentially your kind of acquisition, activation, retention, monetization, like the gross funnel and all the loops that kind of come with that and drive virality and sort of customers essentially arriving at the product and getting value from it. And then core product really looks at building out the actual web and mobile app experiences. So there's a lot of overlap between those two domains. And actually right now I'm kind of straddling both. But they are actually quite distinct in the type of work and the ways of operating within them. And happy to talk a little bit more about that. I've been a freak for just over a year. Feels like a lot longer than that. I think a year in startup time is 10.  
Me: That tends to be the way, right? Many lifetimes.  
Them: Yeah, and before that, been kind of hopping around a bunch of different startup scale ups. Been in product for the last nine, 10 years across HR, software, mining and construction. Been in other marketplaces as well. So really varied, varied background. I love that you can do that in product, just pick yourself up and dump yourself in an industry. Like money and construction and actually be useful. It's just, I think it's crazy and such a cool thing about product. But, yeah, I was drawn to Fleet because I just am really passionate about sustainability and the kind of mission behind it, which is true for a lot of the folks here. We've got a lot of ex resellers, a lot of people that are very passionate about climate. So it's a very mission kind of driven and, and mission centric company, which is cool and something that I was like, that was important to me.  
Me: Amazing. Yeah, I got that impression. I was looking at the Instagram page more to get a sense of, I guess, how you communicate with customers, but did kind of get a sense of the culture at Flek, and it seems positive. That definitely came across. That's also something that I'm looking for that I really value. I think mission driven. In general, I either want to have a kind of preexisting interest or motivation for a particular company, or think that that will be developed pretty easily. And a fleek already ticks those boxes in terms of I buy a lot of vintage clothes. Following my conversation last week, I just kind of got really bought into the mission of leek, so. Yeah, good to hear that.  
Them: Nice. Awesome. Tell me a bit about you. Tell me about your kind of journey until now and also a little bit about what you're looking for and hoping for in your next role.  
Me: Yeah, absolutely. So I guess the way that I usually approach this is just by framing my experience through certain strengths. So it's got a four key areas that I would touch on. So the first is 0 to 1. So I had a product built a company called Crowd Guide, which is a recruitment mentorship marketplace. Scaled us from zero revenue to €500,000 ARR through to an acquisition by Native and then at Native led new products and helped increase revenue from 1 to 5 million pounds over the time that I was there. The second is that I've been a founder and I've been on the founding team of a company. And I think that's really just allowed me to hone a founder's mindset as a result. Particularly in terms of just getting to an impactful solution as leanly as possible. That's really ingrained in me at this stage. Third. The third is that I describe myself as a full stack product manager, so both the technical and design background. So I have a community science degree and a design degree, a UX design degree. And I think that I'm equally as comfortable on the design side mocking up prototypes as I would be kind of talking through the technical implementation details of something or building out information architecture or schemas. As well as, I guess, the kind of technical element of that. I find that it just allows me to communicate more broadly and more effectively with my team, my squad. And then the fourth is AI. And that's definitely something that attracted me to this role. I use it across pretty much all of my product processes and productivity. Ones as well. I built a bunch of working prototypes, some that I connected into art, into our backend, into our database to get something fully functioning internally for buy in and then in front of customers as well. And yeah, I'm working on a few other side projects if we go to Vibe coding projects, but that's certainly something that attracted me to this role, that that's a core, a core kind of element of the role and felt it also had good compatibility with my mixed background as well.  
Them: Nice. Awesome. Did you say the company that you're at now was the company that the previous one you were working at acquired? Was that a sale?  
Me: Yes, well, I left there in August, but yeah, so we were grad guide was acquired by native.  
Them: Gotcha. Nice. Makes sense. So you left native back in August.  
Me: Back in august. Yeah.  
Them: Second August. Okay. And you've just been kind of playing around with AI and upskilling yourself since then.  
Me: Kind of. So I went. Well, I went on holiday first. And then. Yeah. Yeah. So then I think. You know, it's funny. I think it's been really interesting, especially in the past six months. The rate of change and kind of what's, what's possible, and all the things that I was familiar with from, you know, a computer science background kind of comes running back, but you have so much more. Kind of like flexibility in how you can use them, like tools and libraries and these kind of core functionality. You know, it allows a lot of creativity now. So, yeah, kind of upskilling in AI, going for AI, PM roles or a role like this, where it is like a. It is a core component.  
Them: Nice. Cool. Cool. Where did you go on holiday?  
Me: To Thailand. So I went to Bangkok and then down to kolanta for 10 days in total.  
Them: Nice. Very nice. Good. Good choice. I have been to Thailand, but not for years, actually. We used to go to or I went a couple of times to get.  
Me: I cannot.  
Them: So I think pre Tsunami, sadly, I think it's changed a lot since then. But I love that part of the world.  
Me: Yeah. It was.  
Them: Yeah, very cool. Okay, so it sounds like you have a bit of a technical background, very comfortable in design, and then obviously the kind of product, like, third component. There. Where would you say your kind of spikes are? Generally? What I find with product people is that we're very strong generalists and then have kind of spikes in various different areas. And it sounds like you're fairly well rounded. But of these different kind of product UX technical domains, like, where would you say you Spike both from. An enjoyment perspective because I feel like no product manager loves every part of the product manager role. That we just do because we have to, but also from a kind of skills and capabilities perspective.  
Me: Yeah. So I think it's kind of, I guess, worth unpacking the 0 to 1 piece in a little bit more detail, because that illustrates that if I was to pick three, it'd be strategy at the top. Then discovery in the middle and then experimentation down the bottom. I think, like I said, I've been in the founding team of a company, so know what it's like to build out a company strategy and product strategy. And I find it really instructive for my work as a product manager to have that, you know, high level understanding of a business and how to push it forward and then how to kind of not, you know, ladder down or connect those kind of like high level metrics to what we're trying to achieve in product and then the second, yeah, discovery. I really enjoy spending time with customers and users, both from a like, relationship building perspective, but also kind of coding that feedback and then using it to kind of, really, really kind of build out, build out features at those kind of crucial points along the journey or along that kind of funnel and then the third. Yeah, third. Iran experimentation. I kind of have always ran experiments, especially working in a startup. You know, resources are low, so it is really important to, I guess we be really clear about what those levers are along the funnel, along the journey, and then, and then kind of rapidly experiment, either just through modifying what's already existing or, you know, building out a quick prototype or mvp. So I think those are the three, three touch points and three kind of areas that I definitely enjoy working at the most.  
Them: Nice. Okay, cool. Makes sense. I think that strategic piece, as you say in a startup is super important. I think definitely what with something we're looking for here is ability to like really own end to end. We are a really lean team and it sounds like you've worked in similar environments in the past, so that's great. But we haven't kind of carved the product up into 10 very narrow, like, vertical slices. It's. It's very much like, here's an enormous domain and enormous scope. Like, go make it better and make us some more money.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: The scope of the work, so.  
Me: That's it. I mean, that, that's, that's kind of. That's what I love doing. And I think working, you know, working into marketplace products or products or the marketplaces, a large part of it was really about, you know, mapping out what does that kind of process look like from end to end. Really understanding it from kind of like a qualitative and quantitative perspective and then identifying those key levers or things that we need to build, either to build out the structure of the platform or to kind of make those more fine grained adjustments, but really kind of viewing it. As that big picture. That's where I had the most success.  
Them: Nice. Awesome. How comfortable are you with kind of the quant data side of things? So SQL and, and does a little bit of this heavy lifting now, which is great. But yeah, how comfortable are you with that as well as, like, obviously the qualitative, like customer interview based insights?  
Me: Yeah, no, pretty good, I think. Yeah, like I said, like you said, I find I've been querying. At querying, it's equal with AI makes it a lot easier, at least as a starting point, to kind of, like, understand the structure and you can kind of get a little bit deeper and then, yeah, I'VE always used various analytics tools, I guess to call it two things I find to use a Sankey diagrams. Yeah, I find that's kind of both from like a visualization perspective, but also. Kind of you can get into the numbers really easily, but you can also break up the flow by cohort and really identify what those kind of, like, key leverage points are. So I think that's something that I find really useful to call it to call out one thing.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: And then experimentation as well. Comfortable, kind of working within relatively tightly controlled experiments and understand like. Like confidence and power and like, I had to kind of run successful experiment.  
Them: Cool. Nice. Awesome. Also very important, Flek. We are much, much, much more actually heavily experiment driven than we were previously. I think when you're in the very early stages, you kind of just have to take a big swing and like pre post at what, at what, what changes have happened and the impact that's been made. But now we've got a little bit more volume and we've got a little bit more, I guess, maturity and sophistication in both the product and our experiment, like infrastructure. It's definitely not perfect. We've had a few frustrating moments where we've been running an experiment and then we realised that customers are getting segmented. Into both A and B to each. So it's not perfect. We've done a lot of work on it, but we're looking, going into next year to be, like, heavily experiment driven. We're making some quite big changes to the marketplace.  
Me: Great. Yeah.  
Them: Essentially rebuilding it from the ground up. I don't know how has has kind of told you about the new AI grading and, and, like, tooling, but we're rebuilding the entire, like, marketplace on both sides.  
Me: I was going to actually ask you that. So he told me a lot about the AI sorting on the supply side. But that's carrying over to the. To kind of the demand side as well, to customers.  
Them: Yeah, yeah. So. So what that enables on the supply side is just much, much faster. Like inventory upload processes. Which massively streamlines the supply side of the marketplace. We are supply constrained as a marketplace, which basically means that our biggest growth blocker is supply and our ability to essentially get these items and clothes that are in rag houses in Karachi and like mountains that you've seen the picture.  
Me: Right, right, right. Yeah, yeah.  
Them: Mountain of denim. We have to get that on the platform into a state that a buyer can buy it in. So huge unlocks on the supply side, but on the buyer side, what we have that we didn't have before is images of individual pieces. So front, back and label. 3 images per item is what suppliers are uploading. So suddenly we've gone from this place where we've got this marketplace that is largely offline. Like, frankly, you had to kind of post a demand and be like, I'm looking for X and just take a leap of faith. Jump into the void and just hope that suppliers got back to you. And sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. We haven't been able to really power a full E Commerce style shopping experience on fleek. It. It looks and feels that way, but they're behind the behind the hood or like under the hood. There's actually quite a lot of it still offline, and we've had to build all kinds of structure and functionality into the product to enable an offline purchasing experience. We now have these pieces online, and we're aiming to have 100% of our inventory online by the end of March, which just like, transforms what we can do on the. On the buyer side.  
Me: Well. Everything. So every, like, every single piece.  
Them: Good question.  
Me: Or kind of like this is what a kind of valuable. Or this is. This is kind of like the type of quality of this particular batch. And then that will be well documented.  
Them: We're aiming for, like, pretty much every single piece.  
Me: Wow.  
Them: Now. Be 100% of the inventory or probably be more like 80. 85. Like, if you're buying 500 pairs of Levi jeans. As long as you know the supplier is solid and you've seen, say, 10 or 20 of those Levi genes. You can have the confidence to check out on that 500. Whereas on like womenswear, for example, we want to power like a hand pick style experience where you can actually go in and like almost vintage style, basically build your own bundle. A lot of our women's web buyers are very curated in the way that they purchase. They are very kind of aesthetic and style driven. They don't just want a hundred like Nike splash proof jackets, they want a hundred pieces that they have specifically chosen themselves. It's a very, there's very diverse like buying styles across our marketplace. And we've only really been able to cater to one, which is our kind of bulk menswear, like brand purchase journeys.  
Me: Patagonia fleeces.  
Them: Exactly. RALPH Jordan like, there's a, there's a standard stock of like, the, the stuff that, that sells well. And like the women's market, for example, is 70% of the revenue in, in fashion is going through women's wear. And we. And it's. It's more like 20 or 30% of our revenue. So there's, like, such an enormous opportunity there that we just haven't been able to crack because of this inventory being offline. So we've now got this inventory and this, like, amazing opportunity to sell at a rate that we've not been able to. To do before. So we're figuring out what the. What those kind of magical AI Native experiences look like on the bio side. And how do we. How do we use AI not for the sake of AI, but how do we use AI to kind of drive that feeling of. Like magic and, like, a lot of work going in at the moment on kind of recommendations, algorithms, and rebuilding our kind of core infrastructure that sits behind the product. So very exciting time to come in. And a lot of work to be done, but we've got a pretty clear kind of vision of where we want to go now, and it's just a matter of. Of getting there.  
Me: How does that, how does that work for pricing? If, like, you're kind of discounting on bulk, but then also have availability for, like, people who would be selling on vintage, but you have one, you have one kind of set price, but then is it discounted in bulk or how do you, for individual shoppers kind of just pulling pieces cheaper than they would on vinted versus like onfleek.  
Them: Individual pieces. Just say that last bit again.  
Me: So I was just curious if you know, if you have this could be going into like too much detail as well. Buyers is curious to ask the question if you have an individual piece, individually priced, how does that work for like retailers buying a bulk versus like a seller that would be reselling, invented or even just like an individual purchaser.  
Them: Got you. Yes, Good question. So what we have when a, when a supplier uploads an item, we get a range of pricing for them. So from them. So they give us, like, a lower threshold that they'd be willing to put out that item at and an upper threshold for where they would obviously like to see that item. Liquidated at so we actually, in this new world, Kind of control pricing to an extent that we didn't previously. Like our suppliers were previously dictating pricing. They now give us a range and we use all our sort of, again, our systems and our, and our algorithms to figure out, like, what is the, what is the right pricing to start with this product at and how do we. We have like a price decay logic that drops the pricing as the item has been on the marketplace for 24 hours, 48 hours. Like supply demand, essentially, we try and we try and liquidate it. At the highest price possible for the supplier because that also means a bigger cut for us. But if that item's not selling, It drops over time. So that same logic we can apply to, like, bulk discounts. So if you came in and you were going to buy one item, it would be maybe £15, but if you bought 10, 20, 100, 500 of that item, we would have that ability to give you 10% or 15% off. 20% off and the pricing would scale as the volume does. So we've built that functionality in both from an experience perspective and a kind of back end perspective. It's good financial controlling.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty cool. Yeah, because, I mean, it stood out that you have, I guess, two customer groups that are maybe, like, similar behavior but very dissimilar in terms of, like, volume, so. Yeah, that's really cool to hear.  
Them: Yeah, for sure. We have to cater for your kind of very early stage. Like new resellers that are 16, 17, 18 years old and have like £200 of pocket money saved up your big brick lane. Like retailers that are spending 10, 20, 30 grand a month and the volumes that they need to, like, need to purchase. Some of our retailers are buying 10,000 pairs of Lululemon leggings in one go. Like, this scramble that we have to go through to source like 10,000 pairs of Lululemons is wild. But you're right, it's a huge spectrum of smooth. I'm curious to know a little bit about your time at IS it grad guide?  
Me: At Granola.  
Them: Yeah. Just tell me a bit about, like, what? I guess what you built. And how that, like, evolved over time.  
Me: Groguide was it was a recruitment and mentorship marketplace. So we essentially connected employers with job seekers, and then we had mentors as a kind of third side in the marketplace. And the idea was that in upscaling job seekers both through one to one to one mentorship and on demand mentorship and other features that we use to kind of build out their profile and skills. We produce the best possible candidate to then link in with employers who had open job listings on the platform. When I joined, it was just mentors and employers, and we didn't have like a. Like a business model and didn't have a product. So. Yeah, early, exactly like what you were saying, which is why I thought there was a good compatibility as well. So, early days, it was really just about getting the infrastructure right. You know, what do we need to build to get job seekers onto the platform? What do we need to do to get employers interested in hiring those jobs? Seekers. And what does that look like from, like a platform perspective? And then later on we identify that we needed, like about five suitable candidates per role to achieve a successful hire, and then really build backwards from that to kind of build in things like a CV builder and building the on demand mentorship and building other features that both retained our job seekers and upskill them to the level that we needed to have them send across a CV and be a suitable match for. For employers, it's like a high level view of how it worked.  
Them: Yes. Okay, nice. And what. What was the setup there? It sounds like you both looking after the product side. I assume there was a bunch of engineers, designer. Like, what did that look like?  
Me: So, yeah, so we had so I hired, managed a team of four engineers. It was hybrid, so some offshore, some in house, and then a team of. And that was four, and then a team of three designers as well. And I kind of led. Yeah, led that from a product perspective and also designed entirely the v1 of the platform and then led the design of what eventually became the GR platform as well.  
Them: Okay. Nice. So you were managing the engineers as well as the designers.  
Me: Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which was considerable. Left. Yeah. You know, it was really interesting and I think, you know, obviously a massive challenge, but I think it kind of really forces you to, you know, really put yourself in the shoes that the engineers in terms of, like, what's going to be motivating and, you know, how to how to really lead it. Kind of team of engineers, as well as just leading a squad. And having them kind of be really bought into the mission of Grad Guide and feel as though they were contributing to, you know, contributing to that, like, bottom line of finding job seekers a job and making that revenue through the kind of kickback from employers. So, yeah, it was great. It was a challenge, but it was fun.  
Them: Nice. Cool. And I guess where. Where were the big complexities with the product build side of things? Like, where did you. Marketplaces are not easy. Guess that was part of it. But what were the big complexities that you hit when you were building Grad Guide.  
Me: I think the one that stands out was actually, like, you know, accurately matching job seekers with employers. So initially, you know, initially. We just took some preferences and then and asked them to contribute their experience, which we were then able to kind of like tag and use to match up with open rules. Over time. We needed to kind of make that matching process more accurate. So we would. We started scraping their CVs, kind of pulling more information, identifying what the kind of signifiers of a close match with the employer job listings were. So, yeah, that was definitely the kind of, I guess, one of the more complicated aspects of the build. Yeah, that's.  
Them: Did you to kind of help with that matching? Or was this bit pre AI days?  
Me: It was kind of like. Yeah, it was, it was, it was pre AI, so it was more using just waiting, like, each of the elements of the job seekers profile with elements of the elements of the job listing. So, like, things like tidal were rated more heavily, preferences weighted heavily, Experience was younger. And we figured out a system to push more relevant candidates, depending on their experience and years of experience and preferences. Towards that. Towards that role.  
Them: Okay. Nice. And did it do well as a company?  
Me: Yeah. I mean, yeah, really well. I mean, you know, we successfully exited, which is like, definitely, definitely a success story. But, yeah, we kind of really consistently high MPS score from our employers. Culturally did really well. We had a really big presence in Dublin. And in terms of that mission piece as well, I think it was really regarded as, you know, really kind of key part of that early hiring structure and just, like, a really exciting thing to be part of and I guess deepened my, like, understanding of my kind of like, mission driven mindset or how I kind of like to work in a company that I felt like it really did have a really positive impact for everyone.  
Them: Nice. Awesome. I'm conscious of time. I do want to give you a chance to ask any other questions, but just finally curious to know a bit about, like, what you're, what you're looking for, and, like, what your next step looks like. It sounds like you're actively looking right now.  
Me: Sure.  
Them: Yeah. What's. What are you looking forward? Is good that, like, for you?  
Me: So I think yeah. So, you know, I would like to, you know, I've been in an early stage startup, been at a scaling up company early stage, had that kind of very zero to one feel. It's some experimentation. Native was was a blend of both and I feel as though fleek and what I'M looking for is a natural continuation of that, where I can really deepen out and contribute that kind of, I guess, like, analytical. Analytical expertise. And experimentation, but also be part of a kind of bigger, faster, growing company. I've always been, I guess, revenue focused and always able to tie product improvements to the bottom line, and seems like fleek has had a really interesting stage.  
Them: Zero.  
Me: For me to be able to contribute that. Another thing is definitely the aips. So I've been, you know, I found that the communication of value alone that you can achieve through prototyping something at an AI or getting in front of customers, it's kind of supercharges that experimentation piece. So next thing, the next company, Stephanie. Something where I can really embed that in. In my workflow. Also contribute. You know, like I said, I've been building out a product OS to try to encode some of my own product practices. And that mentality is definitely something that I am really keen to, you know, to bring. To the next job and to have, I guess, to be. To be valued. So there's. Yeah, I think those are kind of the two. Two key areas that something I'm looking for next.  
Them: Yes. Yeah. Nice. And what about role? What sort of. Yeah, role and. And areas of the product would you be interested in. In owning?  
Me: Specifically for fleek.  
Them: Well, I guess, just generally, are you more interested in the kind of core product side of things? Are you curious about the kind of growth piece? Because I'm still figuring out exactly how we divide this, like, monstrosity. But I'm just curious to know, like, where you. Yeah. Where you would want to lean.  
Me: Oh, yeah. Okay.  
Them: Either towards growth or towards core, or maybe a bit of both. Like, where's your head at?  
Me: As of right now, I think hopefully I've kind of illustrated this. My strengths lie in understanding that process end to end. Really kind of being able to have a holistic view of the funnel, how it connects to like overall revenue or any other top line metrics that you're tracking. And then go deep on a few of those key levers, run experimentation to kind of, like, improve the, like, conversion or whatever metric we're tracking at those key leverage points. So I'd say that's that. 's what I'm looking for. And I guess maybe what I was expecting in this role. I. 'd be happy to have a conversation about it further if there needs to be a decision between those two areas. But I guess should I lean towards one now, or is it still, like, up for.  
Them: No, no, no. Honestly, just, like, very. I think. I think you answered it well, which was, like, less about the role and actually more about what you want to do. I think that sort of process and that way of working could apply to either core or growth. But it's good to hear that you are interested in that. Kind of experiment driven product development rather than the kind of just the big infrastructure or like core product builds. Because the growth team and the way that we need that to work is very much on a like, fast experiment cadence. We haven't, I would say we haven't quite been able to like, really push the pace. And find momentum and rhythm in that experiment.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: Cadence. And that's something that I really need. This person who comes into own if we do kind of create that domain within growth, which I think is where I'm leaning at the moment. To kind of. Get the engineers involved in the data and the product thinking and the customer problems, translate that quickly into solutions, test, learn, iterate, and just kind of get that flywheel spinning, because I think that's really what it's going to drive progress in that space against whatever metric is important for the business at that time. So and that would be for this person to define as well, like do we focus on acquisition or do we focus on activation? Like there will be top down direction, but it's not, it won't be kind of handed on a sofa platter, which I think is good for the right people, like being able to figure out, like, actually, where are our biggest levers and what. What should we be focusing on for the next quarter? So. No, that gave me good clarity. Thank you.  
Me: Okay, cool. I mean, yeah, that's kind of all I've ever known, so it's good to hear that as well. And it's like, you know, it is how I like to work as well, but that was my impression of the role. Okay. So that's good that I kind of. Yeah, that's. Good that there's alignment there.  
Them: Fair. Enough. For sure there's alignment there. Let me give you the mic and give you the chance to ask me any questions.  
Me: Okay, cool. Are you kind of short on. Short on time on your side?  
Them: I'm good for the next five. There seems to be some presentation going on outside, but I can. I can keep chatting to you and I'll jump in into that in a bit.  
Me: Okay, cool. Yeah, maybe. Let's start, like, slightly bigger. So is there any. Are there any kind of key levers that you've identified at the moment where you see the biggest challenge in creating some kind of, like, disruption or some kind of impact?  
Them: On a business level or on a product level.  
Me: On a. On a product level. Yeah. Just to get a sense of kind of, like, where the, I guess, like, where the main kind of snag points or where the main kind of, like, areas that are, like, available to disrupt or available to create some kind of unlock. But there is going to, like, challenge in achieving that.  
Them: Yes. I mean, there are tons. The biggest bucket for us is always just resourcing. We have all the ideas, we have all the drive, and we have strong opinions on what needs to be done. But we have to prioritize ruthlessly. We have a solid team working in this space, but the domain is enormous and with this what we call flex sort. So the new AI grading kind of come in as a new big bet and swallowed up all the resourcing across every area, which is a good thing for the big bet. And I think what it is required to get it off the ground. But it also means that we are we've had to make hard kind of trade off calls in. In other areas. I think a big one is activation.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Which is basically figuring out how we get our first time users to the kind of value moment or the aha moment as quickly as possible. In pursuit of higher retention rates. So our retention rates have been kind of plateauing, dropping a little bit over time. We need to get that back up. And obviously, retention is a function of virtually everything that the user touches throughout their entire experience with fleek. So there's tons of different levers we can pull and leading metrics that we can move, but one of them, we strongly believe is, is activation. So that first time experience and the first time purchase, we just haven't been able to resource up a stream of work and a team to work on on that. So there's huge opportunity there. It's just, it's massive Greenfield. We've done a bunch of discovery and then just engineers. Were called off and put onto something else. So that should be picked up again. I would love to see that picked up and pushed over the line. Monetization is also a really interesting kind of field. It's probably a little bit early to be pushing hard on kind of new commission structures and, and sort of ads in the marketplace and that sort of thing. But as we kind of get towards the back end of this year, I think it is going to be a stream that is going to open up and be really interesting. How we charge, what we charge, what our commission model and structure looks like. Is it supplier side or buyer side? We have all kinds of like small buyer fee, platform fee, and a lot of it has been put into the platform to kind of stem losses rather than to actually proactively monetize effectively and for sure it's downwards. Pressure on metrics like conversion and retention. I just know it. So there's a lot of work that we could. Could do there as well. I mean, the core product. Is vast as well. It's across web and app. We don't invest nearly enough in web. It's very much a kind of acquisition platform for us. We push. We hard push users direct to app as quickly as we can, and then once they're in the app, we're able to kind of engage and retain them better. Our web platform. I mean, you've probably seen it. It's a bit embarrassing and honestly, like, needs a massive facelift. And it's not just a kind of design facelift that it needs. It really needs someone to sit and think about the platform strategy and the journey that buyers go through. And should we be sending them direct to app or, like, what is the role of web in our, in our world? I feel pretty strongly that a lot of our bigger buyers want to browse and purchase on web on laptops like I just we use speak to customers and some some of them that are spending kind of 3,000, 4,000, £5,000 transaction. I don't know about you if this is showing my age but like those big spends don't happen on phones. Like, I. You don't. You don't book flights on a phone. You, like, open your laptop and do it on your laptop, because it's just a big. It's a big spend.  
Me: Y. Eah. Yeah.  
Them: There's very mixed feelings about Web, but I strongly of the belief that we have it under invest in it.  
Me: I mean, it's a demographic thing as well, especially these shop owners. Like, you know, they're all millennials, so that kind of, like, mental model of, like, big spends go on the big screen, I could definitely attest to that.  
Them: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And some of these guys are sort of 40, 50, 60 years old plus, and not super tech savvy. Like, they don't. They don't. They're not on their phones all day, every day like we are. So there are very different kind of Personas and user groups out there.  
Me: Sure.  
Them: But yeah, there's tons to do on the Core Marketplace as well. And I think once this fleet sort transition has happened, There will be domains within that. So like search and discovery, for example, is a massive domain that we're going to need to heavily invest in. The post order experience, how we showed, like tracking user users, tracking where their order is at and when it's going to be received is a massive gap and blind spot, right? Now. So everything needs a lot of love. But hopefully that gives you some perspective on whether. Whether the blockers are.  
Me: Yeah, definitely. And, I mean, it seems like you have, like, collaborative product team that everyone's kind of considering the, you know, the problem as a whole. Is that, like, an accurate read?  
Them: For sure. We have. We're spread across Karachi and London, so it's actually just. Just myself in London and then we've got three or four PMs in Karachi at the moment looking after supply, finance, ops and cx. So owning those domains kind of end to end across those areas.  
Me: Okay? Okay? So that's, I guess, what, you just play back to me, and that's, like, a lot of, like, what's going on in your head, specifically around the customer side of things.  
Them: Yes. So this is all customer side of things. The supply and options, the access and finance is a whole nother world, but that's currently kind of managed outside of this growth team.  
Me: Okay? Cool. Makes sense. Yeah, I think I. I kind of. I adjusted in a few things. Let me cover it quite a lot in six months time. I know that the remit of this role is pretty bored. Maybe you could call out a few key things that would indicate like a really successful hire here and maybe taking that blend of. Process driven and specific experimentation just to kind of narrow how you would measure success for the role.  
Them: Good question. So I think first thing would be that kind of strategic thinking and really, like, intentional approach to defining what should be worked on. I really want that to come from this role and not from, like, myself or from the VP of Growth who spends time thinking about this stuff as well. So that strong opinion on, like, what should be worked on and why, and being able to really back that opinion in data, both like qualitative and quant data, I think building that experimentation, culture. It's going to take a bit of, like, wrangling with engineers to get the infrastructure in place, but I think it's a worthwhile, like, investment to make getting that set up so that we can run these experiments and having the. Or, like, showing that you have the ability to run a really tight experiment. All the way from designing the experiment through to kind of running it and pulling the, pulling the insides, making a decision about next steps, etc. The full experiment loop, I think that's a muscle that we have not flexed. As much as I would like to culture that I want to build within the team. So that's experimentation. I think the real definition of success will be will be business metrics moving. Ultimately, like that is the kind of I want the team to be impact and like outcome assessed. So obviously shipping is incredibly important and a critical part of that. But if the metrics don't move, then that's a problem, so. And obviously there's tons of different inputs that go into those metrics, so it won't just be that. But I think this, this role needs to really own the movement of those business metrics, especially if it's, if it's within that growth remit. That's really. How we would measure success here. And ultimately, to your point, like the revenue and like commercial outcome of those metrics, moving. Yeah. So I think it's. It kind of straddles, like, the cultural evolution piece, which is, like, establishing that funk, that growth function really, like, pretty much from scratch, to be honest. Like, I've been dabbling with it, and there's a growth marketing team, but that growth. Is this person's kind of domain to really own and, and define all the way through, as I said, the experimentation, culture and how we run tight experiments. Through to the actual like impact of those experiments and business metrics moving.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: Does that answer?  
Me: Yeah, really well. And that. And that's all really exciting. And it seems like there's great alignment, so, yeah, perfect.  
Them: Nice.  
Me: What is. I'll. I'll let you go. I kind of. Yeah. We've gone over five minutes, so next steps is the Akitaco, is that right?  
Them: Yes. So we have a case study. It's part take home and part in person. I don't want you to spend hours and hours on it at home. But equally, some people, including myself, like to do a bit of that kind of at home prep and not do the whole thing in person. So I want. I just want it to be right for you, and it's a balance of both. Take home and in person. As a result, I'll send. I would love to take you through to that, to that next stage. So I will send that case study. As I say, it's. It's a little bit of prep work at home, but a data crunching and sort of analysis. And what I would like to see off the back of that is kind of the results of that Data crunching maybe 24 hours before you come in. And then when you come in, what we'll do is work through, in a kind of live, like, collaborative session, work through a solution, design and build. And then we'll give you a bit of time to kind of mock that up in whatever, like, format you feel comfortable and. And feel is best for that, for that product. So it's quite fun. It's a. It's a good case study. But I'll send that through, and then if you've got any questions, just let me know.  
Me: Okay. Fab. Yeah, we'll do. Was really, really nice to meet you. I really enjoyed the conversation. And, yeah, look forward to meeting in person, then, I guess.  
Them: Yes, if you can, that would be great.  
Me: Yeah, I would love that. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, like, super keen to kind of spend loads of time in the office. It's how I like to work.  
Them: Okay? Actually, that is something that I should have asked because we are a very kind of in person culture.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Flexible as well, like if you need to take a day from home, or if you just want to crunch through some work that needs you to be at home. That's fine, but generally we are trying very much like in person culture here and. And we're hiring engineers in the uk, Our engineers are currently in India, but we're building engineering team to look after the growth side of things here, which is very exciting. We've got a designer here bringing another data. Person in as well. So really beefing out the tech team here, which I'm super excited about. But, yeah, coming in, cs, I'll. I'll introduce you to a bunch of folks here and show you. We've got a whole, like, rails. I don't know if you can see behind me, like. Rails of clothes and all kinds of fun stuff going on here. So I'll send it over and then we'll find a slot maybe next week, sort of middle. Middle to end of next week.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: To come in.  
Me: Yes. Yeah, I'm. Yeah, my. My mom's actually visiting for a little bit, so I might not get too much time to work on it, like, over the weekend, early next week. So. Yeah, maybe. Maybe end of. If that's. If that works better.  
Them: Yeah, End of weeks. Fine. We'll find a slot. Maybe Thursday, Friday, next week.  
Me: Okay, cool. Nice.  
Them: Okay, cool. All right. Thanks so much for your time. Take care. Bye.  
Me: Great. Okay?
