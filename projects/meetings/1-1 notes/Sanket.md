Meeting Title: Hugh Allen and Sanket Agarwal
Date: Feb 6
Meeting participants: Sanket Agarwal

### Company Overview & Funding

- Series B closed recently ($25M raised)
  - Total lifetime funding: $45-46M
  - Key investors: YC, Andreessen Horowitz, German funds (Depop/Vinted background)
  - eBay strategic investment with significant check
  - Declined Vinted investment due to competitive conflict
- Revenue trajectory: $10M last year → targeting $25M this year
- Positioned as “operating system for secondhand industry”

### Business Model & Supply Chain Innovation

- Supply-constrained marketplace (secondhand items are unique, can’t be manufactured)
- Unique supply chain discovery:
  - Western donations shipped to East (India, Pakistan, Dubai)
  - Suppliers don’t understand fashion value - selling premium items for pennies
  - Fleek enables 10x-20x price increases for portion of inventory
- Fleek Sort app breakthrough:
  - Automates grading/sorting process via photo recognition
  - Custom-built model (LLMs too expensive at scale - processing millions of pieces daily)
  - Solves literacy/fashion knowledge barriers for suppliers
- Buyer side experience:
  - Continuity and reliable inventory sourcing
  - Bulk purchasing (500+ item orders common)
  - Social platform features (chat, make offer functionality)
  - Used to require travel to Pakistan/Dubai - now digital
  - Expanding the market (new resellers starting because of Fleek access)

### Current Challenges & Growth Focus

- Problem: Growing users → GMV → acquire & retain
- Strong acquisition but weak activation/retention
  - Need focus on entire customer lifecycle, not just top-of-funnel
  - Revenue comes from retention, not just acquisition
- Funnel optimization across entire lifecycle critical
- Looking for product-first thinking at $10M+ revenue scale

### Next Steps

- Follow-up interview scheduled with senior PM
- 45-minute deeper dive conversation planned
- Role focuses on full-stack builder with analytical skills and product taste



Transcript:
 
Them: Hello.  
Me: Hey, how's it going?  
Them: It's going well, man. How are you doing?  
Me: Yeah, yeah. Not bad. It's good to meet you.  
Them: Nice to meet you. Are you in London area or in Dublin area?  
Me: London. I'm based in London, so I live, like, in the. In the barbican, so not too far from the office. From your office.  
Them: That's very nice. I see you are in London. I guess your previous role was in Dublin. That's right.  
Me: Roll before last. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.  
Them: Yeah. That's robust. All right, let's get started. You have a very interesting profile. You've also kind of worked in something similar to us, at least in the thread. A couple of the threaded. So that's what Phoebe was talking to me about. So maybe you want to give introduction. Tell me more about yourself. And excited again.  
Me: Cool. Yeah. So I guess the way that I would usually describe myself would be in four main sections or like four main strengths. So the first is 0 to 1. So I led multiple 0 to 1 builds as had a product at Grad Guide, which was that Dublin based startup I built an early career recruitment and mentorship. Platform and scales from zero revenue to €500,000 ARR through to an acquisition by Native where it then led a new product development and helped us to increase revenue from 1 to 5 million over the time that I was there. The second point is that I've been a founder, so we can talk about threaded after this. So I've been a founder and you know, been on the founding team of a company and I think as a result of really develop defenders mindset. The third point is that I'm a full stack pm. I know people kind of throw that word around, but I have both the technical and design background. So I have yes degree. And I did a UX master's. Excuse me. And I think, you know, I think it just speaks to how I approach my work as a builder. I've kind of multiple iterations of that full stack have kind of. I guess I've been moving through, starting with building websites and helping people with that, and then designing grad guide and then building with AI. But I think it just really helps to communicate more effectively with the people around me and my team. And then the. Four.  
Them: Let's talk about that, because I feel like. I feel like everybody has their own workflow.  
Me: Sure.  
Them: Right? And everybody's figured out their own unique way to use AI. And it's interesting, you say that you call yourself, like you call it a full stack builder, right? Is that the phrase you used?  
Me: Well, so full stack product manager. But, but, but I think that word is synonymous with builder. At least it is for me.  
Them: So tell me about your workflow. Like, what do you. What do you. What do you actually use AI for? And where you have. Where have you found leverage that you feel like it's unique to you?  
Me: Yeah, in a few different ways. Something that I've been working, like something that we worked on and found really useful, is building out a task. And this could be a little bit too detailed. So just, like, call me out if I. If it gets, like, a bit too. But using. Yeah. So building out a task manager and like Knowledge center in cursor and then also building out my product management workflow and then having those two. There are two separate projects, but they work together. So I have a task manager that connects to my Obsidian and to Granola, and it kind of like pulls in tasks from Granola meetings. And it also I I kind of erratically transferred all of my knowledge into Obsidian and categorize it. So I have like a full product knowledge base that I can draw from into this task manager. So it knows my goals and then also knows kind of the priority of tasks and what I need to get done, both in work and personal. Life. So that's the first project that I kind of just, you know, helps me stay on track and.  
Them: I've heard good things about obsidian. So do you use obsidian as almost like a knowledge base? Essentially.  
Me: I use it as a knowledge base. Yeah, exactly. So I have, like, I have it connected to my Granola just to have a record of meetings, and then I have all of my different, like, product workflows and stuff that I'm interested in and yeah, like, a ton of other kind of things that I'M tracking, I guess that I'll. If it's not, like, in progress and it's, you know, done enough just to be able to be stored in storage, then I'll put it into Obsidian to be called later on. So there's like. Yeah, so task is number one. I told you this might. Be detailed. So task is number one.  
Them: Dude, I am. I'm an absolute geek. So let's geek out.  
Me: Yeah. Cool. Okay. So that's. Yeah, that's the first part. The other one is. Yeah, like a product manager OS kind of style. So that has. I've staged out kind of each of the main phases of how I consider product management, both in terms of discovery and delivery. It's kind of a combination of things that. Are stored in Obsidian and then prompts that are kind of like leveraging the Obsidian knowledge to be able to run through a certain product process. And I find that really useful just to use as a thought partner, but also to offload some product management work. So like writing PRDs are like helping to kind of prioritize things or, you know, for research as well. It does a ton of different things. I'm still optimizing what's best to do myself. Right. And then what's best to be able to offload or what's best to work on together. But, yeah, I think, yeah, in terms of kind of things that affect my work and my personal life, those two build, I think, are probably the most effective. I'm also, you know, I have a time background. So I've vibe coded a bunch of different, like, applications with, like, Auth and, like, kind of making sure that I'm able to do that right until I hit something that I think is going to be commercial and then I'm able to build it out. So, like, I have that capability and I'VE used that in in my previous role as I built out prototypes, I built out like Insights tool that I connected to our BigQuery database. So that was a working prototype that we were able to put in front of customers and have them use it with pretty minimal dev engineering resource and also just helps to communicate the value of a product and get buy in. So that level.  
Them: So do you get, like, deep into, like, figma and just, like, start, like, hacking your way through it until you get something that you like?  
Me: In terms of. Well, in terms of, like, what I. Where I've had most success is either. I guess it depends. It totally depends on the fidelity of the design. Right. So, like, I would use lovable if I just wanted to get something out quickly. I'd use V0 if I wanted to build out something. With more of a design system behind us that I could then take that code base and put it into cursor and build on top of it. I also have had success with bolts. I guess it kind of depends on what exactly what the use case and what you trying to build.  
Them: I have a question. Like, you know, the. The feedback that I often get from the team is like, how do people find time to do this? Like, how do you find time to learn all these things? Or like, how have you found it effective? While also, like, because fraud management itself is like, heavy on communication and problem solving and identification and, and also want to understand, like, how have you used AI for data? If, like, that's something that's been there, but, like, first, like, how do you find time to learn or how do you think about that?  
Me: It's funny, I think. I think the past six months or so have just been particularly exciting for this world of light vibe, coding and seeing how model capabilities have advanced. And, you know, I did a. I think I did a computer science degree, but then very quickly went into design and then went into product, and I think that this is kind of activating all of the things that I might not necessarily have been interested in before. So I have the kind of base understanding of how these systems work and kind of like what libraries look like and kind of like the structure of web applications they used to build websites. So I think I had all of the base component parts, and then it was just about attaching that to, like, how I think about product. And, like, I consider myself pretty process driven, and I like to kind of be able to understand my own process. And where I can have the most effect and share that with other people. So I think, yeah, I don't know. I think it's about. Yeah. I don't know. It's a spec. Like having a strong interest in it and connecting it back to the work and seeing where you can run your own experiments to kind of like accelerate work. So I would say that the time. In summary, I think the time saved. In these kind of, like, unlocks, you kind of. You're able to use that time save to learn more about it, and then it kind of has this, like, push.  
Them: This is exactly the way I think about as well. I think when you get started, it can feel a bit overwhelming. But the funny thing is, like my co founder, abhi, he's. He. He gives me this example. It's like if you ask a person who's really stressed out or if a therapist is. Talking to a person who's really stressed out. Therapists will say you should meditate. And the guy will be like, well, I don't have time to meditate because I'm really stressed out. And therapist. Well, you need to meditate more, you know, so it's, it's, it's that, like, you know, got to find time to do that so that you start to create space. And then that actually leads to that, like in a flywheel of learning almost, you know, and it's very cool you haven't had that experience of being an engineer, a designer and a product manager, because I think that's. You're an interesting, unique position where AI is really helpful for you because you can merge those worlds together, right? Bring them or come. Bring it together or close it to you, which, you know, you can just leverage more.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's kind of, you know, that's what partly excited me about this role that. What Phoebe mentioned that you're looking for somebody who kind of has that, like, I guess, like, full stack or like, that builder mentality. It's something that I found, you know, obviously interests me. And excites me, but also has kind of like been such a core part of my world. Like when I was head of product grad guide, I hired a manager in engineering team, a design team, and then also designed the first version of the actual platform itself. And I just found that the ability to flex between those roles was really important.  
Them: Let's get deep on your grad guide experience. So tell me about the journey. So also tell me about, like, was it funded? Was it bootstrapped? Like, tell me about the founders. Like, just tell, like, help me understand what the situation was and help me understand the journey to take it to half a million of revenue. That's pretty fantastic. I want to understand, like, where the revenue come from. Like, what were some of the key milestones you guys launched? Like, just take your time and explain to me your journey over there.  
Me: Cool. So I joined. So I joined just as we got funding, interestingly enough. Mark Hughes, who was the founder of Grad Guide. I did that the threaded with him in my final year of university. So that's kind of, that's how I got involved. He like gave me a call. So I joined just as the other co founder who's got funding to make five of us and then became a founding head of product for the company. And, yeah, and it really was kind of, it really was 0 to 1. So what they got funding for was an existing mentorship network where these four co founders and Mark and three others have been connecting job seekers who had just finished university with mentors who would then. Run through the basic skills of job seeking. So writing cv, interviewing, teaching them about different types of companies. Mainly tech focused at that stage. So the funding was off the back of that and it was like to private vc. From. We kind of went in under the other kind of more legacy tech companies, I guess you could call us. So we were like the startup within that portfolio. So it was an interesting, like, interesting setup. So I was. Yes, that was the funding and then Journey. Yeah, I mean, it was. Yeah, it was really exciting. Like I said, I designed the platform hard and managed engineering team and design team, but also, you know, worked on the proposition with the co founders. The group to commercialize in the company was introducing employers into the mix. So grad guide as it existed before was just job seekers and mentors, so there was no way to actually generate revenue. The kind of the unlock was introducing employers into that three sided marketplace and then charging them a subscription fee to gain access to those job seekers. And then the mentors acted as a way to upskill job seekers materially to make them the best possible candidate for employers. And they would, you know, essentially be pre onboarded. And we also, like, massively shortened the time to hire for our employers. So those are the two. The two kind of key call outs that we did that we used when selling this into employers was that you could have time that it would take to actually get a successful employee and that they would pre onboard it onto your company because a lot of the mentors worked at those partner companies. So that was a basic structure. The kind of, I guess, to give you an idea of like, maybe like funnel, I suppose you could call it, are North Star metric was that we had a minimum of five suitable candidates per role posted for our employers, and then it was just a case of working backwards from what the employers required and what was going to be. Sticky to keep jobs seekers signing up and then actually being on the platform, cutting up that kind of like, funnel or cutting up that workflow to say, well,  
Them: So it's very interesting. I think you said that you and my guess is that when you say that, you mean the product is not Star wars getting five employee employments for an employer like a five roles closed. Is that the what it is?  
Me: Five. Five suitable candidates per listing. Yeah.  
Them: And why was that the number you guys chose? Was there, like, some rational behind that, or how did you guys come up with that number?  
Me: That it would. It would kind of provide them with enough candidates that one of them was going to be suitable for the role given. Given that there was already this kind of mentorship, both on demand and one to one, that would upskill them and make them suitable. That if we were able to kind of get. Both through matching the candidate and pointing them towards the role, given their preferences and skills, that once they arrived on the job listing page, then there would be five suitable candidates that could do the role and the employer would pick one. And then that would guarantee us our like subscription fee and also guarantee that the candidate would be hired. On stay and pass probation.  
Them: And, and, and then did you guys see, because of that, was there, like, a ripple effect on retention? Did you guys measure that? On either, I guess on the employer side because they are the one who are paying money. But like, did you see like. It's very interesting because I'll tell you why I'm asking that. Because right now we at trying to decide what is our activation metric.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Which is similar to what is like if you, if you come for the case study, that might be the case study, which is like defining the activation metric in a way. And then just cue, like, were you able to see, like a long term or something like that? You were like, hey. If this happens, an employer spends $100,000 over the year. Or, you know, you guys were there for two years. So, you know, whatever, like, amount of money.  
Me: I guess our. Our activation metric on the employer side was more qualitative in that it was kind of the amount of job listings and then their satisfaction. So, like, their mps, if we're talking, like, We were more, because we had that kind of revenue as a metric on the employer side. We were more retention metrics driven on the job seeker side because we needed to ensure that there was a critical mass of job seekers that were actually signing up in the first place, that were converting, that were either connecting with the mentor or that were participating in some of the on demand content we had on the platform. And then we're filling out their profile and CV to a certain level of depth that we could then kind of match them with a job seeker or match them with an employer. Sorry if it was going that way or the employer is also had access to a talent call, so they needed access to kind of enough metadata to be able to, like, funnel or access suitable candidates for their role. So.  
Them: I see. In a your supply side, which is your candidates really is the one that you're nurturing and growing. And focusing on so that they can become, like, eligible for jobs.  
Me: I mean, I guess so. I think, I think we did, you know, we really did consider it to be a three sided marketplace. And I think that there was a we, we kind of translated employer requirements. And, like, sticky features for job seekers to ensure that critical mass and then sequence out the roadmap like that. But in terms of, yeah, in terms of, I guess, like, nurturing, maybe that was more on the, on the job seeker side to make, to make sure there was enough.  
Them: In your three side marketplace, what side would you say was the most constrained, hardest to get access to, hardest to grow? Like which ones? Which one was the hardest?  
Me: Mentors. Definitely, yeah.  
Them: Oh, wow. I would not have expected that.  
Me: We didn't. What? So we didn't. We didn't pay them. So it was like a kind of altruistic thing. And I think that. That, you know. Yeah, I think that if we had. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. They were kind of. It was, well, easy, I think. Easy to get people to do, like, one kind of mentorship, maybe hard to retain them. So a way that we kind of move past that challenge was putting a lot of the mentorship content on the platform on demand, and then also building out mentorship features to kind of keep them on the platform for longer like we had. Templated mentorship sessions that they could use and track their progress with a mentor. And we found that that kind of added to their, like, participation, I guess.  
Them: Kind of very fascinating. Why'd you guys not pay them? I mean, like, I understand that, like, money is always a constraint, but, like, did you ever make the argument that, like, hey, if he pay them, Then there's more roi on the other side, and then it pays for itself.  
Me: Yeah. I mean, I think. I think that we. Didn't like. We totally honest. We didn't, like, fully consider it as an option. We talked about it. We thought that it would, like, potentially get in the way of. Because a lot of those mentors had relationships with our partner companies that would kind of, like, get in the way of that relationship and would also detract from some of the more, like, altruistic people that were joining Grad Guide that we wanted to that we wanted to keep. And there was a certain brand associated with Grad Guide as well, where it was viewed as, certainly from the mentorship angle, as very, like, altruistic and that they were giving back to, like, kind of, like, paying it back, and we thought that they would eliminate that. Branding thing really?  
Them: It's the ethos of the company that matters as well. Like, I, I remember I was talking to somebody who's, like, very senior at Etsy, and he was talking about how there was a culture that everybody was kind of solo entrepreneur in a way, and that was the thing that was very celebrated. So you know, it depends upon the ethos of the company, which makes a lot of sense. Okay.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Last question, and then we should move on to, like, some of the questions that you might have for us. Tell me more about the setup. So, like, you were working with and you're a native as well right now? Like, what's, what's your working setup right now? Or what was your working setup at, like? Grant guide. Like, how many engineers, how many prod managers, how many designers? What was the, what was the deep structure like?  
Me: Sure. So Grad Guides. Yeah. So at Grad Guide, it was a team of four engineers and there was a hybrid team, and then we had four developers or four designers. Sorry. And then I was the only product person I definitely went to. Relied on our sales and marketing team a lot to, like, extend out that kind of product function and make sure that I was kind of, I guess, applying product sense to our different audiences and sales as well. It was very collaborative in that way, but that was what it looked like, a grad guide. And then at native, it was total of like six. Six engineers with three product managers. But we had a junior product manager. Who would kind of go between the two of us. So I led on like new products and building out our advertising proposition. And then the other PM built out like a ticketing and events platform. That Native also had.  
Them: And that's a data or that's a credit guide.  
Me: Sorry. Say that again.  
Them: The last thing you said that's more native, right? That now that you guys and how. And you said a native. There's two PMs.  
Me: That was. There was two and a like product owner. Yeah.  
Them: Fraud. Owner. What's the difference?  
Me: Product owner like did. I guess didn't like. Worked on more detailed work. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Them: Okay, fair enough. Fair enough. I'm sure there's a. There's rational behind that. And how big is the native team overall?  
Me: Around 90 people. So actually, I left in August, but it was kind of like the right 90 people. There.  
Them: What you been up to since August? What you been doing?  
Me: I kind of, like. I took a break, went on holiday. That was nice. I went to Thailand and then, yeah, I've been, like, working on. Working on kind of a lot of AI stuff, so, like, kind of.  
Them: You know, it's interesting, like.  
Me: Fine. Tuning that, like. Oh, yeah, fine tuning that. Os going to, like, kind of AI builder meetups. That's been fun, kind of getting.  
Them: I think there's a bunch of people. So we just hired somebody recently. His name is Alex and he is more from a finance background. He is the ex founder. XYZ founder. Started his own company, sold his own company. And he had, like, a break of about six months. And he did exactly what you were talking about. Like, got deep on AI, started playing out with workflows and tools and. And he's like. He's not an engineer, but, like, I think there is this. What you're doing is really smart. Which is learning a lot about AI because, you know, like the problem I said before, which is when you don't have the time. Then it becomes this thing about, like, meditation. Like, how do we meditate when you are so stressed out? So I think. I think it's a good thing to upskill yourself for six to seven months because it gives you such a massive jump start. Such a massive so. So kudos to you. Okay, so we have seven minutes left. And I want to make sure that I give you enough time and, of course, like we can do for subsequent conversations as well. But what would you like to learn most about? We can talk about the business team problem or all of them in some sequence. What's most interesting to you?  
Me: Yeah. Cool. I think what I'd love to start with the problem on your customer, talk a bit about the team, and then talk a little bit about just, like, your funding situation. But let's spend, like, maybe half the time talking about the actual, like, problem. And I did get a chance to read a little bit. I read like a tech crunch post and had a quick look at your LinkedIn, so I kind of get the vibe. But maybe we can jump to what problems with like brick and mortar retailers have you already been able to solve with fleek? Like, what kind of problems were they facing? And what have you already been able to solve for them.  
Them: Further. Let's go through that. I'll cover the funding first so that, like, you know, the pressure is off. So we just finished our series, just finished our Series B funding, like, maybe, like a month ago. We've raised in the Series B $25 million. Lifetime, we have raised about 45, 46 million dollars. Also the reason why we are now going in up on a small hiring spree. Not really a lot but trying to get high levers people, especially the AI world. Funding has been pretty robust overall. Key players that you might know about. YC invested first Andreessen Horowitz. After that. We have had a couple of German funds. After that for series A and Series B. The German funds have been folks who have invested in Depop invented respectively. So there's. Yeah, strong alignment because of that.  
Me: Hold. On. That's cool.  
Them: And one. One person I'd be very excited about is ebay came into the pretty giant check. So strong strategic partnership, because, you know, the race is really heating up in this space right now, and it's been heating up for a while, but I think there's a bit of a. My gut feeling is in about two to three years, there's going to be another crescendo where there's a few different companies in this space. So. And we have a very unique value proposition that nobody really has. So everybody kind of looks at us as that operating system for this industry. That's why, like, we actually had offers from ebay and. Vinted for investments. We actually had to decline winter because of conflict of interest, but ebay was okay. They were like, the terms because we were, like, wilted, felt too close in terms of, like, we actually wanted to go against them. We were like, we want to go compete with them at some point. So, anyway, so overall, very, very fun funding round. Had a lot of fun and a lot of validation for what we're doing? Now problem that we're solving, and this is important. So we are. And, you know, it will go back to the. The thing that we were talking. I was asking about which size of the marketplace is constrained. Secondhand marketplaces. No matter which marketplace you look at, no matter what they're selling, it's a supply constrained game. And the re the reason is because these items that you're selling are unique. And they don't get manufactured. So if, let's say you're buying Rothle insured, you actually can't get 100 of them tomorrow if you wanted to. Because, you know, you don't manufacture that. You can go to, like, I don't know, like, China and be like, hey, let's manufacture 100 profit insurance, right? So it's a game of supply aggregation. Now, the problem that we are trying to solve, the two sided marketplace that we have, is there's an insane amount of demand for secondhand. But there's not enough supply and that's what vintage Depop whatnot. Like ebay are struggling with, right? What we have figured out is this very unique but incredibly, I would say, diverse supply chain where when people donate their items in the West, They actually don't stay in the West. They get accumulated, all these warehouses, and then they get shipped over to the East. And we might have some of that, and they get sorted over there. And I want to show you this image of. To help you understand what do we actually deal with on the supply side so you understand the problem statement. This is actually what an import of secondhand clothing looks like. After you. This is how clothing is actually imported into the East. Once donations have been done. Then after that, they go through this process of grading and sorting. It literally looks as messy as it looks over here. And you can see, like, people going through it. This maybe is a slightly better, more organized picture, but we are dealing in an incredibly clunky and unorganized supply chain. And still this is the biggest supply chain in the world when it comes to secondhand clothing, because everything ends up in these places. It gets accumulated. What we realize is these people actually don't know the value of the items they have because these people are not close to fashion. Right? I mean, can imagine, like, somebody in, like, Pakistan, like, is not really curious about what Y2K bell bottom jeans are, right? So when we went in there, we saw that they were selling their items for like, like, you know, pennies and the pounds, literally. And we came and we said, like, you can make 10x20x easily for a portion of your inventory, not all of it a portion of inventory. And they were absolutely, like, taken aback. They were like, that's not possible. You sound like a scam. And we were pretty shocked. We were like, look, either we have landed on gold mine or we are probably wrong. Like, maybe these atoms don't sell. That was four years ago. Right now, what we have is a pretty strong kind of, like, I would say, traction in the supply chain, where our suppliers are mostly in the East. So they're india, pakistan, dubai. Who are themselves importing raw material from the West. And then reprocessing it, segregating it, creating this, like, stacks and bundles and so on and so forth, and then sending it all around the world. So they don't just send it to London or Europe, but they're sending around the world. The most premium inventory, let's say 5 to 10% of the inventory that they have. Which is the majority of the revenue actually gets sold in the west. Because, you know, people over here are, you can pay like £10, but somebody in Africa will probably want to pay $0.50, right? Because person parity comes into the picture. Right now. That's kind of the core supply chain we are in. One big innovation that we have had which actually has really pivoted the entire business really positively. And you're talking about AI is we've been able to do something very unique for these suppliers, is actually automate the process of creating and sorting. And that's been the key thing, because if you look at this factory, This factory right here. Probably Noble impact, so I actually know Noble impacts. They probably process about half a million pieces of clothing a day. Right. That's crazy, right? And you can see that, right? You can. You can imagine looking at this picture, it's a big floor, maybe two or three floors. Factory, right? Half a million is reasonable. Everything over here will get processed and, you know, shipped out based on, like, wherever the customers are. Now, what they challenge was, they were like, look, we can educate our people on fashion to the depth that you want us to. Like, we can teach Brandis. Some of these people are illiterate. They can't read, and. Write. So how do you teach them about passion is so as you can imagine, we built it's called the Fleek Sort app. It's actually available on App and Play Store where they can we have the fleet vendor app, which is a main app. The Fleek Sort app is the one that we have built. Recently, and it has completely changed the game because all they have to do is take a picture. And then we. Had to build our own model because most models out there add half a million or like we are talking 10 to tens to hundreds of millions of pieces a day. You can't really run LLMs on that. You'll blow all your money on token cost. So we actually truly had to dig deep. Like build a team internally and then build the technology. What this means on the buyer side. And, you know, of course, the role that we're focusing on is more the buyer side as well. Is, we have to also completely reimagine what the experience looks like. Right. Our buyers are not looking for one or two pieces, they're looking for a bundle. Some of them are businesses. Right. So a lot of people that buy from us are stores in Brooklyn and you probably wear a Brooklyn and like the second hand stores over there. The buying experience over there is completely different. Right? It's more about, like, how do you buy in bulk? It's more about, like, you know, repeat buying behavior. It's also about how do you save time for them. Because think about the experience of if somebody comes and says, I want to buy 500 rawfer and t shirts, right? Like you might not have it from the same supplier. How do you aggregate the supply together, right? On top of that, it's a very, very social platform and something that you're aware of, you're familiar with that as well. There's chat functionality, there is like, you know, make an offer, so on and so forth. So a lot of functionality that you can see in, like, vintage or depop, if you've used them, but it's like at the B2B scale. So to summarize, incredibly, manual supply chain that we're bringing online for the first time by building technology. And a buyer base that has actually no other alternative other than freak. And that is why I think we are, like, very uniquely positioned and very attractive as a company. Is that. And look, nobody wants to. It's hard to get into the supply chain, like, Unless you're on the ground in these countries. India, Pakistan, Dubai, which we are. It's very hard to get rational supply chain. Very hard. Because it's, it's about relationships, about technology, it's about process, it's about speaking the language. And, and that's kind of. My co founder, I think we, we got lucky. That you know that me and him are both Indians, so we speak the language of those countries in general, so it helps. Anyway, so I gave you a crash course. Any questions on that?  
Me: Well, yeah. I mean, very good sell. First of all, I think I was, you know, obviously, like, super interested and do have an interest in, like, vintage anyway, like, vintage fashion. But, yeah, that sounds. I mean, that sounds really exciting. I really enjoy herobatha supply chain. I think something that really kind of gets me going is, like, uncovering process, whether that's, like, internal functions or, like, really understanding what the process is happening with here customers, like, not just positively, but, like, really kind of getting into the detail. So I'd love to kind of. I'm already starting to visualize that, and I think that's super. Interesting.  
Them: Look and look, you know? I think it's the, it's the iceberg kind of visualization, which is what you see on Joinfleek is like the tip of the iceberg, what surfaces but the real fun. And by the way, that experience is very critical to build out, but the real one is what you just talked about what's below the water level, because that's where the magic happens. That's where people don't understand and realize what's going on. But, you know, that's where you build your boat. It's easy to stand up a website with bundles on it. It's very hard to understand how the heck do these bundles come in the first place. Right? That's always the hard part.  
Me: So in terms of. In terms of what's been built out now and for your existing customers, what are, like, what are some of the key problems that you've been able to solve as a result of kind of being able to, like, tie together the supply chain and build a product on top of it?  
Them: Good point. So I'll talk about both things, which is what we've been able to solve and what are the biggest challenges we have, because it'll help you understand.  
Me: Great. That was going to be my. My follow up.  
Them: Yeah. So I think what we did by stitching the supply chain together is we were finally able to solve this problem of pro sellers or resellers. And shops not being able to source inventory in a continuous, reliable fashion.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Because in a business, you need inventory, and you need it every month. And you need it to be high quality, need to be stable, right? Like, that's how business runs. Business is all about continuity, right? And before Fleek came in. It was risky. It was hard. It was. It required a lot of travel. These people actually used to travel to Pakistan and Dubai and as you can imagine, like. So it's. It's. It's the. It's the Alibaba kind of equivalent. Like, you know, before Alibaba, people were probably flying to Schengen to, like, figure out where the inventory or what the manufacturer is, like.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So we're truly the Alibaba of this industry. Right now. That's been the big enablement. And I think what we have seen is and what we are seeing actively is like fleek is actively expanding the market, which is very exciting because if you look at most generation companies and we are like big fans of YC where YC company. Why is he always talks about that if you have to build a generational business, at some point you to start creating your own market. Right. If you want to build a $100 billion business like there is not 100 billion dollar market out there just for you to capture, you might have a billion dollar market and then you have to expand the rest. 99 right. And we're starting to see that right now already, where because of fleek. People come in, they say, like, hey, I started reselling because I could buy a bundle. And I've graduated. Right. And I think that's the. The thing that you're seeing is that massive amount of. Top of massive amount now challenges. I think we have not focused as much on growing these people. Right. So, you know, you talked about, like, the whole mentorship thing, like, maybe slightly different, but we focused on a lot of the acquisition, but we have not spent as much time on activation and retention. Which is? How do you make these people stick around on the platform? And spend more and more money. Which is where, by the way, fleek makes money, right? We don't make money just because we acquired customers. We make money when they retain. Is good for top line acquisition is not always good for bottom line. Right? CAC and all that kind of stuff. So I think that is also kind of goes dovetails into the role as well. The role that we're looking for over here is somebody who can think prod first, has good product taste. Has strong analytical skills. Is a full stack builder. So I would say you have a lot of the ingredients. We definitely want somebody who can like also think at our scale because we are like, you know, like about 10 million in revenue last year, aiming for 20, 25 million revenue this year. Right. So we need to also have somebody can think at that scale. And really can start thinking about the funnel, not just from acquisition perspective, but like the entire lifecycle of the customer. Because now we're going to graduated from being like an early stage company to like, we're creating real value. Right. So how do you compound that value? I hope I gave you a quick answer. Now I will also say I'm very sorry. I will have to almost immediately jump off because I have another interview I have to go to. But how about this? I enjoyed chatting with you. If this is interesting for you, I will schedule the next test for you.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah, I would love that. I really enjoy this conversation, and it sounds like kind of a really exciting stage to join you guys at, so definitely, definitely happy to move it forward.  
Them: Yes. So we have a. We have a fairly senior PM that we have in our team. Let me set up my time with you, with her. And what you can do is you have other questions, go deep, and I'll make sure that their conversation is maybe 45 minutes, so you guys get a bit more depth over there, all right?  
Me: Cool. Okay, sounds good.  
Them: All right, take care. Bye.  
Me: Okay, thanks. Bye.
