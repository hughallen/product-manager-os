# Design Reference Library

## Purpose

This is an **optional folder** where you can store design patterns, screenshots, and examples from your product. AI can reference these when helping you create design specifications or briefs.

## How It Works

### Simple Approach
1. Drop screenshots or descriptions of your product's key screens here
2. When creating design briefs, mention this folder to AI
3. AI will reference your existing designs to maintain consistency
4. That's it - no complex design system needed

### What to Store Here

**Keep it simple. Add only what's useful:**
- Screenshots of key product screens
- Notes on common patterns you use (if any)
- Links to your actual design system or Figma files
- Any design decisions or conventions worth documenting

### Folder Structure (Optional)

You can organize however makes sense to you:
```
design-reference-library/
├── README.md           # This file
├── screenshots/        # Product screenshots
├── patterns.md         # Quick notes on any patterns (optional)
└── links.md            # Links to Figma, design system, etc. (optional)
```

## Usage

**When creating design briefs:**
```
"Create a design brief for [feature]. 
Reference @pm-toolkit/5-design/design-reference-library/ for consistency 
with our existing product."
```

**When discussing designs:**
- Point AI to screenshots here for context
- Reference patterns you've documented
- Ensure new designs align with existing product

## Benefits

- **Consistency** - New designs reference existing patterns
- **Context** - AI understands your product's design language
- **Speed** - Less back-and-forth explaining your design conventions
- **Knowledge capture** - Design decisions documented in one place

**This is optional.** Only populate this if you find it useful. Many PMs keep design references in Figma or other tools and that's perfectly fine.
