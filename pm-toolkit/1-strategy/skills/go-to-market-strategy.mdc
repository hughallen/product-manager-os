# Go-to-Market Strategy

Creates a complete GTM plan with channels, messaging, timeline, and success metrics.

## When to Use This Skill
- Product launches
- Market expansion
- Major feature releases
- Enterprise sales plays
- New segment targeting

## The Problem

GTM plans are either 50-page decks nobody reads or back-of-napkin ideas that miss critical channels. Most launches fail from poor GTM, not bad products.

## What You'll Need

**Critical inputs (ask if not provided):**
- What you're launching (product, feature, expansion)
- Target customers and segments
- Launch date/timeline

**Nice-to-have inputs:**
- Available resources (budget, team)
- Competitive positioning
- Sales motion (PLG, sales-led, etc.)

## Process

### Step 1: Check Your Context
First, read the user's context files:
- `context/product.md` — What you're launching, value prop, pricing
- `context/personas.md` — Target segments, buyer profiles, pain points
- `context/competitors.md` — Competitive positioning, differentiation
- `context/company.md` — Team structure, sales motion, marketing channels

**Tell the user what you found.** For example:
> "I found 'Resource Planning v2' in your product.md as the launch. Your Jordan persona (PM) is the primary buyer — they care about 'workload visibility.' Your competitors.md shows Monday.com as the main threat. I'll build a GTM plan targeting Jordan with positioning vs Monday."

### Step 2: Gather GTM Context
If you don't have enough context, ask:
> "Before I create this GTM strategy, I need:
> 1. What are you launching? (I found [X] in product.md)
> 2. Who's the target buyer? (I found [personas] in personas.md)
> 3. When do you want to launch?
>
> I can pull positioning from competitors.md and channel strategy from company.md."

## What You'll Get

- GTM one-pager + detailed plan
- Target segment prioritization
- Channel strategy with owners
- Messaging matrix by persona
- Launch timeline with milestones
- Sales enablement checklist
- Success metrics (30/60/90 day)

## Process (continued)

### Step 3: Define Launch Type and Goals
Clarify what you're launching:
- New product
- Major feature
- Market expansion
- Pricing/packaging change

Set measurable goals.

### Step 4: Identify Target Segments
Prioritize segments:
- Who benefits most?
- Who's easiest to reach?
- Who has buying authority?
- What's the buying process?

### Step 5: Map Channels to Segments
For each segment:
- How do they discover products?
- What channels reach them?
- What's the cost per acquisition?
- Who owns each channel?

### Step 6: Create Messaging by Persona
Tailor messaging:
- Different personas care about different things
- Map features to benefits per persona
- Create proof points per persona

### Step 7: Build Timeline with Milestones
Plan the launch:
- Pre-launch activities
- Launch day activities
- Post-launch activities
- Checkpoints and decision points

### Step 8: Define Success Metrics
Set measurement plan:
- 30-day metrics (leading indicators)
- 60-day metrics (engagement)
- 90-day metrics (business outcomes)

## Framework Reference

**GTM Strategy Components:**
- **Segment:** Who you're targeting and why
- **Channel:** How you reach them
- **Message:** What you say to them
- **Timeline:** When it happens
- **Metrics:** How you measure success

**Common GTM Motions:**
- **Product-Led:** Trial → conversion → expansion
- **Sales-Led:** Outbound → demo → close
- **Marketing-Led:** Content → MQL → SQL → close
- **Channel-Led:** Partner → referral → close

## Tips for Best Results
1. **Use your context files** — I'll build on personas, positioning, and competitive context
2. **Focus on primary segment first** — Spreading thin kills launches
3. **Own the timeline** — Launches without dates don't happen
4. **Metrics at each stage** — Leading indicators before lagging
5. **Sales enablement is critical** — They can make or break launch
6. **Plan the post-launch** — Day 2-90 matters as much as day 1

## Suggested Updates
After creating the GTM plan:
- [ ] Update `product.md` with launch date and success metrics
- [ ] Create sales enablement using `/sales-enablement-kit`
- [ ] Create launch checklist using `/launch-checklist`
