# Devil's Advocate

Challenge PRDs and specs with critical questions and potential failure scenarios.

## When to Use This Skill
- Pressure-testing a proposal before stakeholder review
- You want someone to poke holes in your thinking
- Looking for blind spots and hidden risks
- Preparing for tough questions from skeptical stakeholders
- Something feels too easy — you want a reality check

## What You'll Need

**Critical inputs (ask if not provided):**
- The document to challenge (PRD, proposal, spec, strategy doc)

**Nice-to-have inputs:**
- Specific areas you're worried about
- Known risks or concerns you've already identified

## Process

### Step 1: Check Your Context

First, read the user's context files to ground the challenge in their reality:
- `projects/company-context/` — Past failures, known constraints, org dynamics
- `projects/product-artifacts/` — Technical debt, current problems, resource limits
- `projects/personas/` — User behavior that might contradict assumptions
- `projects/competitors/` — How competitors have failed at similar things

**Tell the user what you found:**
> "I found in projects/company-context/ that your last AI feature took 2× longer than planned due to data quality issues. I'll challenge any assumptions about data readiness. I also see from projects/competitors/ that Monday.com tried this and removed it — I'll explore why."

If context is thin, say:
> "I don't have much context about past failures or constraints. I'll use generic challenge questions, but you can add more to projects/company-context/ for more grounded pushback."

### Step 2: Review the Document

Read the full document carefully. Look for:
- **Assumptions presented as facts** — "Users want this" without evidence
- **Optimistic timelines** — "Should take 2 weeks"
- **Dependency handwaving** — "Sales will handle this"
- **Missing sections** — What's NOT addressed?
- **Vague language** — "Improve", "better", "enhance" without metrics
- **Scope creep potential** — Features that will grow
- **Edge cases ignored** — What happens when...?

### Step 3: Take Contrarian Perspective

Your role is to **push back constructively**. You're not trying to kill the idea, you're trying to make it stronger by surfacing risks early.

**Challenge everything:**
- Is the problem real? Or are we solving for an edge case?
- Do users actually want this? Or is it what we think they want?
- Will this work technically? Or are we underestimating complexity?
- Is now the right time? Or should we wait/deprioritize?
- What are we NOT doing because we're doing this?

**Look for:**
- **Hidden assumptions** — What are we taking for granted?
- **Failure modes** — How could this go wrong?
- **Unintended consequences** — What second-order effects might occur?
- **The hard questions** — What will skeptical stakeholders ask?

### Step 4: Identify Blind Spots

What hasn't been considered?
- User segments that won't want this
- Technical constraints that make it harder
- Competitive responses that could neutralize value
- Regulatory or legal implications
- Support/maintenance burden
- Documentation and training costs

### Step 5: Generate Output

Create a comprehensive challenge document with:
1. Critical questions (organized by assumption)
2. Potential failure scenarios (with likelihood/impact/mitigation)
3. Blind spots identified
4. Unintended consequences
5. The hard questions to prepare for

**Tone:** Constructive challenge, not dismissal. Frame as "Here's what could go wrong, let's prepare for it."

## What's NOT in This Document

**Missing sections:**
- [ ] [Section that should exist but doesn't]
- [ ] [Analysis that's needed but absent]

**Vague areas that need clarification:**
- [Area 1]: [What's vague and needs specificity]
- [Area 2]: [What needs quantification]

---

## Stress Tests

**If user adoption is 10× lower than expected:**
- Is this still worth doing?
- What's the minimum viable success?

**If this takes 2× longer to build:**
- Does it still make sense?
- What gets cut?

**If a competitor ships this first:**
- Do we still build it?
- What's our differentiation?

**If the team shrinks (key person leaves):**
- Can we still deliver?
- What knowledge is at risk?

---

## Recommendations

**Before proceeding:**
1. [Action to address highest risk]
2. [Action to validate critical assumption]
3. [Action to prepare for most likely failure scenario]

**Things to watch for:**
- [Early warning sign 1]
- [Early warning sign 2]

**Questions to answer now:**
- [Question 1 — must answer before starting]
- [Question 2 — must answer before starting]

**Questions to defer (but track):**
- [Question 3 — can answer later but don't forget]
- [Question 4 — monitor as you go]

---

## Final Challenge

**The question you don't want to ask but should:**
> "[The uncomfortable question that gets to the heart of the risk]"

**The conversation you're avoiding:**
> "[The discussion with stakeholders that needs to happen]"

**The assumption you're most worried about:**
> "[The thing that, if wrong, would make this fail]"

```

---

## Framework Reference

**Contrarian thinking and failure mode analysis**:
- Surface assumptions before they become failures
- Challenge everything, even things that "feel right"
- Ask "What if we're wrong?" about every key decision
- Look for second-order effects and unintended consequences
- Use "pre-mortem" thinking: Imagine this failed — why?

This skill uses **pre-mortem analysis** (imagining future failure) and **assumption mapping** to strengthen proposals before they ship.

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Don't take it personally** — This pushback makes your proposal stronger
2. **Keep context files updated** — I'll ground challenges in your real constraints, not generic ones
3. **Be honest about what worries you** — If you're concerned about engineering feasibility, tell me
4. **Use this before high-stakes reviews** — Surface objections in private before public meetings
5. **Don't dismiss challenges too quickly** — Sit with uncomfortable questions before explaining them away
6. **Update your document** — Address the critical questions before stakeholder review
7. **Use iteratively** — Challenge → fix → challenge again

---

## Calibration

**If you want lighter challenges:**
> "Focus on top 3 risks only, not comprehensive"

**If you want harder challenges:**
> "Be maximally skeptical. Assume worst case on every assumption."

**If you have specific concerns:**
> "I'm most worried about [X]. Challenge that assumption hard."

## When NOT to Use This Skill

❌ **Don't use when:**
- You're still brainstorming (too early for rigorous challenge)
- You can't handle critical feedback right now (wrong headspace)
- The document is already in execution (too late to change course)
- Low-stakes decision that doesn't warrant deep scrutiny

✅ **Use when:**
- High-stakes proposal (big investment, big risk)
- You feel like it's too easy (suspiciously smooth)
- About to present to skeptical stakeholders
- Want to prepare for tough questions
- Something just feels off and you want to articulate why
