# PRD: [Feature Name]

**Status:** Draft | Problem Review | Solution Review | Approved
**Owner:** [PM Name]
**Last Updated:** [Date]
**Target Release:** [Date/Quarter]
**Availability:** [All users | Business tier | Pro tier | Enterprise only]
**Rationale:** [Why this tier?]

## Context
*What I found in your files:*
- **Roadmap:** [Feature status from product.md, or "Not currently on roadmap"]
- **Persona pain:** [Relevant quote or insight from personas.md]
- **Strategic fit:** [How this aligns with priorities from company.md]
- **Competitive:** [Do competitors have this? From competitors.md]

## Problem
[What problem? Who has it? In what situation?]

## Evidence
[User research, support tickets, data, quotes]

*Mark assumptions clearly:*
- ✅ **Validated:** [Evidence you have]
- ⚠️ **Assumed:** [Things you're inferring — flag for validation]

## Success Criteria

### Lagging Indicators (post-launch outcomes)
| Metric | Current | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| [Metric 1] | [Value or PLACEHOLDER] | [Value] | [When] |
| [Metric 2] | [Value or PLACEHOLDER] | [Value] | [When] |

### Leading Indicators (pre-launch signals)
| Metric | Current | Target | What This Predicts |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Value or PLACEHOLDER] | [Value] | [e.g., predicts adoption] |
| [Metric 2] | [Value or PLACEHOLDER] | [Value] | [e.g., predicts quality] |
| [Metric 3] | [Value or PLACEHOLDER] | [Value] | [e.g., predicts retention] |

💡 **Leading indicators help you course-correct before launch.**

## Proposed Solution

### How It Works
[High-level description of the approach]

### User Stories (Examples)
*Include 2-3 concrete user stories to illustrate the solution and help engineering understand edge cases and scope boundaries.*

**Story 1:**
- **As a** [persona]
- **I want to** [action]
- **So that** [benefit]

**Story 2:**
- **As a** [persona]
- **I want to** [action]
- **So that** [benefit]

**Story 3 (if needed):**
- **As a** [persona]
- **I want to** [action]
- **So that** [benefit]

## Non-Goals
- [What we're explicitly NOT doing]

## Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies
- **[Feature/System]**: [Why we need it] — [Status/Timeline]
- **[Feature/System]**: [Why we need it] — [Status/Timeline]

### Team Dependencies
- **[Team]**: [What we need from them] — [Timeline]

### External Dependencies
- **[Third-party/API]**: [What we need] — [Risk if delayed]

**Critical Path:** [Which dependency blocks launch if delayed?]

💡 **Flag dependencies early to avoid last-minute surprises.**

## Risks
*Risk types: V=Value, U=Usability, F=Feasibility, B=Business Viability. Impact: H=High, M=Medium, L=Low*

| Risk | Type | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| [Risk] | V/U/F/B | H/M/L | [Plan] |

## Open Questions
*For each unknown, suggest a validation approach to turn assumptions into testable hypotheses.*

| Question | Assumption | How to Validate | Timeline |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| [Question 1] | [What we're assuming] | [Experiment to run] | [When we need answer] |
| [Question 2] | [What we're assuming] | [Experiment to run] | [When we need answer] |

**Example:**
| Do agencies want automated balancing or manual control? | Automated preferred | 5 user interviews + prototype test | Before sprint 1 |

## Before Finalizing
Before you ship this PRD, double-check:
- [ ] Does `competitors.md` show competitors have this? (table stakes check)
- [ ] Did you miss any recent user feedback that contradicts this approach?

## Sign-off
| Role | Name | Approved |
|------|------|----------|
| Product | | ⬜ |
| Engineering | | ⬜ |
| Design | | ⬜ |
```

## Framework Reference

This skill uses **Marty Cagan's V/U/F/V Risk Framework** from *Inspired* and *Empowered*:

- **Value Risk:** Will customers buy/use this?
- **Usability Risk:** Can users figure out how to use it?
- **Feasibility Risk:** Can engineering build it with current resources?
- **Viability Risk:** Does it work for sales, legal, finance, etc.?

The goal is to address the biggest risks BEFORE building, not after.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Keep your context files updated** — The more I know about your product, the better this PRD will be
2. **Be honest about evidence** — "I think" is fine, just label it as assumption
3. **Non-goals are as important as goals** — They prevent scope creep
4. **Update the PRD as you learn** — It's a living document, not a contract
